National Curriculum Framework for School Education
1.5 Introduction 
The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF) is developed based on the vi-
sion of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, and to enable its implementation.
The NCF addresses education for the age group 3 to 18 years, across the entire range of diverse 
institutions in India. This is across the four Stages in the 5+3+3+4 Curricular and Pedagogical 
restructuring of School Education as envisioned in NEP 2020.
  NCF from the NEP
  The NCF brings to life the aims and commitments of the NEP. 
a. The Aims of Education are articulated in the NEP from which the curricular goals for the  
 
NCF are derived which then informs the rest of the elements. 
b. This includes the full range of human capacities, values and dispositions that are aimed  
 
to be developed in school education. Pedagogy, practices, and culture must work in tandem  
 
to develop these, and move away from an overemphasis on memorization and content 
 
accumulation; in fact, content reduction is required to create space for such development.
c.  The 5+3+3+4 Curricular and Pedagogical structure of school education is reflected in  
 
the learning standards, the content, the pedagogy, and the assessment approaches 
d. It is integrative and holistic with equal status to all subjects and learning domains from  
 
Math to Sports. It integrates vocational education in all schools, and there is integration  
 
across subjects while developing rigorous subject understanding and capacities. 
e. It confronts and address real challenges facing our countries’ education system. Notably  
 
that of literacy and numeracy, rote memorization, narrow goals, and inadequate resources.
f. It is deeply rooted in India. This is in content and learning of languages, in the pedagogical  
 
approaches including tools and resources, and most importantly in the philosophical 
 
basis – in the aims and in the epistemic approach.
Let us consider some of the directly relevant matters. 
Curriculum
Curriculum refers to the entirety of the organized experience of students in any institutional 
setting towards educational aims and objectives.
The elements that constitute and bring to life a Curriculum are numerous, and include goals and 
objectives, syllabi, content to be taught and learnt, pedagogical practices and assessment, teach-
ing-learning materials, school and classroom practices, learning environment and culture of the 
institution, and more.
There are other matters that directly affect a Curriculum and its practice or are integrally related 
while not being within the Curriculum. These include the Teachers and their capacities, the in-
volvement of parents and communities, issues of access to institutions, resources available, ad-
ministrative and support structures, and more.
12
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Curriculum Framework
The Curricula across our country must be informed by and be fully responsive to the glorious 
unity and diversity of India. The imagination of NEP 2020, where institutions and educators are 
highly empowered - including to develop Curricula - is energized by this diversity and the nur-
turing of it. States have the Constitutional mandate to provide high-quality education to all chil-
dren, and their own unique State contexts inform their own approaches to Curricula.
A Curriculum Framework must support exactly that - it is a framework to help develop all 
the diverse Curricula in the country, while enabling consonances and harmony across the 
country and providing a basis for quality and equity.
Thus, a Curriculum Framework provides the guiding principles, goals, structure, and elements 
for the development of Curricula, informed by which the syllabi, teaching-learning-materials in-
cluding play materials, workbooks, and textbooks, and assessment methods will be developed by 
the relevant functionaries, including Teachers, in the States, Boards, and schools.
Objectives of this NCF
The overarching objective of this NCF is to help in positively transforming the school education 
system of India as envisioned in NEP 2020, through corresponding positive changes in the cur-
riculum including pedagogy.
In particular, the NCF aims to help change practices in education and not just ideas; indeed, since 
the word ‘curriculum’ encapsulates the overall experiences that a student has in school, ‘practic-
es’ do not just refer to curricular content and pedagogy, but also include school environment and 
culture. It is this holistic overall transformation of the curriculum that will enable us to positive-
ly transform overall learning experiences for students.
Structure and presentation of the NCF to enable 
its Objectives
While based on the most current knowledge based on research and experience, this NCF aims to 
be understandable and relatable to, and usable by, practitioners of education, including Teachers 
and other educators, school leaders, and functionaries of the education system such as project 
officers, cluster and block resource persons, block education officers, teacher educators, exam-
ination boards, and curriculum/syllabus/textbook development teams.
The NCF also aims to provide the interested reader a reasonable understanding of what educa-
tion should look like in our new vision for schools and why, and what role individuals could play 
as parents, community members, and citizens of India, who all have a large stake in Indian edu-
cation.
Nevertheless, this NCF is designed with the Teacher as the primary focus - the reason being that 
the Teacher is at the heart of the practice of education. It is the Teacher who is ultimately the 
torchbearer for the changes we seek. As such, it is the perspective of the Teacher that must be 
carried by all, including syllabus and content developers, textbook writers, administrators, and 
others.
13
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
This NCF thus aims to adopt a presentation style and structure that enables the above objectives 
of readability, accessibility, and relevance. While it aims to articulate the underlying philosophy 
and principles, it does not simply leave it at the level of abstraction but also brings it to practice.
To enable this, and to communicate ideas with greater clarity, this NCF contains different levels 
of detail and specificity at the level of practice, with clear real-life illustrations in a variety of 
contexts. The Teacher or curriculum developers are not bound by these illustrations, but it is 
envisaged that this level of detail will help to make this NCF graspable, relatable, and useable.
This NCF also aims to account for the reality of the current typical institution and Teacher, while 
being entirely in harmony with the imagination of the best-resourced institutions. Thus, this NCF 
aims to be deeply rooted in the reality of our context, yet aspirational.
Volume in hand and those to follow
The volume in your hand describes the NCF comprehensively. 
To enable the objective of making the NCF as relatable to practitioners as possible, eight volumes 
will follow, of which seven would be on the specific Curricular Areas – Arts and Music, Languag-
es, Math, Science, Social Science and Humanities, Sports, and Vocational Education, and one will 
be on School Culture and Processes. The volumes that are to follow will have greater details on 
the specific matters, to enable the implementation of the NCF, and its use by practitioners, from 
curriculum and textbook developers, to, teachers and assessors. 
While the NCF-FS is included with this NCF, the NCF-FS document must be considered as another 
of the detailed volumes, making the set all together of ten volumes, including the volume in hand.
This integrated overview volume of the NCF is structured in five parts, which are further divided 
into chapters as follows:

Associated documents
While the NCF is sufficient for its purposes, nuances can be arrived at better, particularly in the 
context of the overall education system, when it is read in conjunction with the NEP 2020 and the 
draft NEP 2019. The Mandate Document for NCF (2022) was the bridge between the NEP and 
draft NEP, and the NCF. 
The NCFTE that is under the process of development will be informed by the NCF, and thus must 
be read in conjunction. The NCFAE too will draw from the NCF.
15
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Few key characteristics of this NCF to keep in mind as 
you read
a. Goal directed: The entire approach is driven by the curricular goals which are derived from  
 
the aims; these tie everything together and are center stage.
b. Practice enabling: It attempts to convert and distill mattes to practice which is where  
 
education happens or doesn’t. 
c. Educationally valid: It’s based on sound research, experience, and accumulated knowledge  
 
in India and across the world.
d. Engaging: Education must be made interesting and exciting both to the children and 
 
teachers. 
e. Improvement driving: Must be able to change things on-the-ground within practical  
 
constraints and limitations and keep moving forward.
f. Diversity embracing: India’s diversity in all its forms must not only be addressed but  
 
should also become a resource for learning.
g. Mutually reinforcing elements: All dimensions mentioned above are mutually reinforcing;  
 
as are the curricular goals, content, pedagogy, school culture and practices, assessment and  
 
evaluation.

 Aims and Curricular Areas of   
 School Education
This chapter defines the Aims of School Education for this NCF and indicates the curricular ar-
rangements that would assist in achieving these aims. These aims are derived from the purposes 
and goals articulated in NEP 2020, and their more elaborate articulation in DNEP 2019. 
The chapter first reiterates the vision of the Indian society as envisaged by NEP 2020 and the 
purposes of education, and the characteristics of individuals that such an education would devel-
op, who would contribute to this vision. 
The chapter then organizes the vision provided in the NEP 2020, into specific Aims of School 
Education that give clear direction for developing the NCF. 
These Aims are to be fulfilled by developing appropriate Knowledge, Capacities, and Values and 
Dispositions. The chapter articulates these. 
School curriculum is a deliberate and organized set of arrangements intended to achieve these 
Aims. These arrangements include – subjects that are taught, the pedagogical practises, books 
and other teaching-learning-material, examinations and other forms of assessment, school cul-
ture and processes, and more. Then there are a range of matters that directly affect learning, 
such as the appointment of teachers and their professional development, admission of students 
and the composition of students, and physical infrastructure.
Among these many arrangements, school culture and processes and the subjects (curricular ar-
eas) to be taught along with their associated academic process such as pedagogy and assess-

ment, have particular relevance in terms of achieving the Aims of School Education. The last 
section of the chapter gives a brief outline of these arrangements that are appropriate to achiev-
ing these Aims.  
21

Section 1.1 
Vision of Education drawn from NEP 2020
Education is, at its core, the achievement of valuable Knowledge, Capacities, and Values and Dis-
positions by an individual. 
Which Knowledge, Capacities, and Values and Dispositions are ‘valuable’ enough to be developed 
by education is decided by the society, which in turn is informed by the vison that the society has 
for itself. Thus, it is by developing the individual that school education contributes to the realiza-
tion of the vision of a society. 
The overarching vision of India is articulated in the Constitution of India. Drawing from this vi-
son of India, the vision and purpose of education is articulated by the NEP 2020 as below:
“This National Education Policy envisions an education system rooted in Indian ethos that contrib-
utes directly to transforming India, that is Bharat, sustainably into an equitable and vibrant knowl-
edge society, by providing high-quality education to all, and thereby making India a global knowl-
edge superpower.” [NEP 2020, The Vision of this Policy]
The vision, thus, is developing an equitable and vibrant knowledge society. This social goal is to 
be achieved by developing desirable qualities in an individual through education. The purpose 
and aims of education have been detailed in NEP 2020: “The purpose of the education system is to 
develop good human beings capable of rational thought and action, possessing compassion and 
empathy, courage and resilience, scientific temper and creative imagination, with sound ethical 
moorings and values. It aims at producing engaged, productive, and contributing citizens for build-
ing an equitable, inclusive, and plural society as envisaged by our Constitution.” [NEP 2020, Princi-
ples of this Policy]
The NEP 2020 further elaborates on the aim of education “The aim of education will not only be 
cognitive development, but also building character and creating holistic and well-rounded individ-
uals equipped with the key 21st century skills. Ultimately, knowledge is a deep-seated treasure and 
education helps in its manifestation as the perfection which is already within an individual. All as-
pects of curriculum and pedagogy will be reoriented and revamped to attain these critical goals.” 
[NEP 2020, 4.4]
The vision for education is thus to develop well-rounded individuals capable of rational thought 
and action equipped with sufficient knowledge and appropriate capacities and possessing desir-
able moral and democratic values. 
22

Section 1.2 
Aims of School Education
The vision of education articulated in the NEP 2020 would be achieved by school education by 
developing, in individuals, desirable values and dispositions, capacities, and knowledge. A cur-
riculum, thus, is a systematic articulation of what these desirable values and dispositions, capac-
ities, and knowledge are and how they are to be achieved through appropriate choice of content 
and pedagogy, and other relevant elements of the school, and presenting strategies for assess-
ment to verify if they have been achieved.
1.2.1 Definitions
Before we elaborate on the Aims of School Education it is useful to clarify the meanings of the 
words – knowledge, capacities, values, and dispositions as used in this document. Here is a brief 
explanation of what is meant by these words in this NCF:
a. Knowledge, that we refer to in this document, is descriptive knowledge – ‘knowing that’. For  
 
example, knowing that the earth revolves around the sun, or knowing that Mahatma Gandhi  
 
played the central role in India’s independence movement. A very large part of the  
 
understanding of the world is through this form of knowledge. This form of knowledge is  
 
expressed through theories, concepts, and principles. In a way, this form of knowledge,  
 
reveals to us the truths about the world. While knowledge of this form might appear to be  
 
factual, the focus of education is not merely remembering these facts, but the ability to  
 
reason about why these facts are true. How can we know if the statement ‘earth revolves  
 
around the sun’ is true? What are the sources of evidence? What are the methods of  
 
justifications? School education needs to focus on these aspects too.
b. Capacities, that we refer to in this document, are procedural knowledge – ‘knowing how’.  
 
For examples, knowing how to communicate effectively or think critically or how to play  
 
kho-kho. The abilities and skills acquired through this form of knowledge enable us to act  
 
based on our understanding. Usually, procedural knowledge is used in the context of  
 
embodied abilities, like the ability to drive a car, but problem-solving and reasoning are  
 
procedural knowledge too. We refer to such broad know-how like critical thinking, problem- 
 
solving, effective communication as capacities, and these capacities can be broken down into  
 
more narrower skills like addition, or decoding. Often acquiring descriptive knowledge  
 
requires capacities too, for instance in the science, the capacities and skills for observation  
 
and experimentation are central to building descriptive scientific knowledge. For e.g.,  
 
without the skills of observation it is difficult to truly justify that the earth revolves around  
 
the sun. For a student to attain a capacity or a skill, the ability needs to be consistent and  
 
repeatable, and it also needs to be adaptable to different situations. For e.g., to be skilled in  
 
making pots or doing addition, the student should be able to exercise that ability  
 
successfully not just once, but many times consistently and accurately, and should be able to  
 
work with different materials or numbers.
23
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part A
c. Values and Dispositions. Effective action needs strong motivation in addition to knowledge  
 
and capacities. Our values and dispositions are the sources of that motivation. Values are  
 
beliefs about what is right and what is wrong, while dispositions are the attitudes and  
 
perceptions that form the basis for behaviour. Thus, in addition to developing knowledge  
 
and capacities, the school curriculum should deliberately choose values and dispositions  
 
that are aligned with the aims of education, and devise learning opportunities for students  
 
to acquire these values and dispositions.
Box A-1.2-i 
Pramanas
Thinking about knowledge, on how does one know, and what are the true sources of 
knowledge has been a philosophical preoccupation for Ancient Indians. The following six 
pramanas were considered as valid means through which one can gain knowledge about 
the world:
1. Pratyaksa: This is usually interpreted as direct perception through the five senses. It  
 
can be further divided into anubhava (direct perception) or smriti (remembered  
 
perception).
2. Anumana: Using inferences to come to new conclusions from observations is one  
 
another way of coming to know. 
3. Upamana: Knowing through analogy and comparison is upamana. Relating to existing  
 
knowledge and identifying the similarities and differences and thus coming to know  
 
new things or experiences is another valid way of knowing.
4. Arthapatti: Knowing through circumstantial implication is arthapatti. 
5. Anupalabdi: Perception of non-existence is considered a valid form of knowledge. To  
 
observe that the well is empty of water is knowing something about the well. People  
 
have come to significant conclusions because “the dogs did not bark that night”! 
6. Sabda: In some systems of knowledge the testimony of an expert is admissible as true  
 
knowledge. That an individual can only directly know a fraction of all reality through  
 
direct experience and inferences but must rely on other experts was acknowledged  
 
thousands of years ago!
These different pramanas were recognized as valid or invalid sources of knowledge by 
different philosophical systems of Ancient India. These ancient investigations of the 
nature of knowledge are still relevant for education. By having a deeper grasp of the 
nature of knowledge teachers are better equipped to select appropriate content, pedago-
gy, and assessments to achieve the aims of education.
24
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part A
1.2.2 Aims of School Education for this NCF
The purposes, vision, and the goals of education (as in earlier sections) have been organized into 
five Aims of School Education. These Aims give clear direction to the choice of knowledge, capac-
ities, and values and dispositions that need to be included in the curriculum. 
a. Rational Thought and Autonomy: Making choices based on rational analysis and a ground  
 
understanding of the world and acting on those choices is an exercise of autonomy. This  
 
indicates that the individual should have the capacity for rational reasoning and sufficient  
 
knowledge to understand the world around them. This understanding develops through  
 
knowledge in breadth and depth. Thus, achieving knowledge in depth and breadth, becomes  
 
one of the key goals in the NCF.
b. Health and Well-being: A healthy mind and a healthy body are the foundations for an  
 
individual to pursue a good life and contribute meaningfully to society. School education  
 
should be a wholesome experience for students, and they should acquire capacities and  
 
dispositions that keep their bodies and mind healthy. 
c. Democratic Participation: The knowledge, capacities, and values and dispositions  
 
developed are to be oriented towards sustaining and improving the democratic functioning  
 
of Indian society. Democracy is not just a form of governance, but it is a “mode of associated  
 
living”.  The goals articulated in the NEP 2020 point to the development of an individual who  
 
can participate and contribute meaningfully to sustaining and improving the democratic  
 
vision of the Indian Constitution. 
d. Economic Participation: In the current context of India, a healthy economy needs to go  
 
along with a healthy democracy. Effective participation in the economy has positive impacts  
 
on both the individual and the society. It provides material sustenance for the individual and  
 
also generates economic opportunities for others in society. The achievement of these aims  
 
makes individuals productive members of the economy. The exposure and preparation of  
 
vocational education in particular develops capacities and dispositions to enter the world of  
 
work.
e. Cultural and Social Participation: Along with democracy and the economy, culture and the  
 
society play an important role in the “mode of associated living”. Cultures maintain  
 
continuity as well as change over time. The NEP 2020 expect students to have ‘a rootedness  
 
and pride in India, and its rich, diverse, ancient and modern culture and knowledge systems  
 
and traditions’. They should also acquire capacities and a disposition to contribute  
 
meaningfully to culture.
A society with individuals who are healthy, knowledgeable, and with capacities and values 
and dispositions to participate effectively and meaningfully in a democracy, economy, and 
culture would be a vibrant, pluralistic, and democratic knowledge society.

Section 1.3 
 Knowledge, Capacities, and Values and 
Dispositions
The central purpose of schools as formal educational institutions is the achievement of valuable 
knowledge, capacities, and values and dispositions by their students. What is desirable is guided 
by the Aims of School Education as articulated in the previous section. Thus, the knowledge, ca-
pacities, and values and dispositions that are to be proposed by the NCF should be towards 
achieving these Aims. 
1.3.1 Values and Dispositions
India has been a great contributor to the discourse of values from the ancient times till today. The 
exploration of humanistic and pluralistic values is embedded in its traditions and its Constitu-
tion is a beacon for democratic values. The NEP 2020 derives its values from these traditional 
sources, the broad humanistic values, and the Constitution. 
Autonomy, health and wellbeing, democratic/economic/cultural participation can be achieved 
through these broad categories of values: 
a. Ethical and moral values. These values include among others: the “values of seva, ahimsa,  
 
swacchata, satya, nishkam karma, tolerance, honest hard work, respect for women, respect for  
 
elders, respect for all people and their inherent capabilities regardless of background, respect  
 
for environment, etc. will be inculcated in students.” [DNEP 2019, 4.6.8.2] These values are  
 
virtues that students need to develop, and these are beneficial both to the individual, in  
 
terms of their health and well-being, as well as to society as a foundation for democratic  
 
values. 
b. Democratic values. These values include “democratic outlook and commitment to liberty  
 
and freedom; equality, justice, and fairness; embracing diversity, plurality, and inclusion;  
 
humaneness and fraternal spirit; social responsibility and the spirit of service; … commitment  
 
to rational and public dialogue; peace; social action through Constitutional means; unity and  
 
integrity of the nation…” [DNEP 2019, 4.6.8.3] 
c. Epistemic values. These are values that we hold about knowledge. Developing a scientific  
 
temper is as much a value orientation towards the use of evidence and justification, as much  
 
as understanding current scientific theories and concepts. “Inculcate scientific temper and  
 
encourage evidence-based thinking throughout the curriculum” [DNEP 2019, 4.6.1.1]
Along with the above values, the NCF would intend to develop the following dispositions in  
students:
d. A positive work ethic. Any form of achievement, if it needs to be achieved through just and  
 
equitable means, require honest and deliberate work. This includes learning achievements  
 
too. While hard work and perseverance contributes personally, being responsible and taking  
 
up and completing an honest share of work contributes to situations where work is  
26
National Curriculum Framework for School Education

accomplished collectively. Respect towards various modes of work – with hands, with  
 
technology, household work or factory work is very desirable. Developing these dispositions  
 
in students become a very important goal for school education.   
e. Curiosity and wonder. Curiosity and wonder are at the core of learning, and with this  
 
disposition students can become lifelong learners. The very young child comes with natural  
 
curiosity to engage with the social and practical world around them. This needs to be  
 
sustained, extended, and expanded. If knowledge needs to be active and alive and not  
 
passive and inert, students have to approach knowledge with curiosity and wonder. The  
 
world around us is a limitless source for developing this disposition.   
f. Pride and rootedness in India. The Aim of cultural participation indicates that students  
 
should develop dispositions that make them rooted in the Indian context. Right in the vision  
 
of NEP 2020 it is stated that “The vision of the Policy is to instill among the learners a deep- 
 
rooted pride in being Indian, not only in thought, but also in spirit, intellect, and deeds, as well  
 
as to develop knowledge, skills, values, and dispositions that support responsible commitment  
 
to human rights, sustainable development and living, and global well-being, thereby reflecting 
 
a truly global citizen.” The notion of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, the world as one family,  
 
emerges from this rootedness. With the varied and common shared interests to hold  
 
strongly within, Indians can aspire to have a free and fair interplay with the rest of world  
 
with assurance and confidence.  
While the above values and dispositions are broad categories, more specific values and disposi-
tions that are relevant to particular curricular areas have been articulated as part of the learning 
standards of those areas. 
1.3.2 Capacities
While values and disposition are sources of motivation to act, acting skilfully requires students 
to have specific capacities. These capacities can be developed through deliberate and conscious 
engagement and practice. The Aims of Rational Thought and Autonomy, Health and Well-being, 
Democratic/Economic/Cultural Participation indicates the necessity of the following broad set 
of capacities. 
a. Inquiry. To act rationally, we need an understanding of the world around us. This  
 
understanding needs abilities of observation, collection of evidence, analysis, and synthesis.  
 
Experimentation and innovation are the practical aspects of this capacity. Beyond these  
 
general capacities of inquiry, there are discipline-specific skills like laboratory skills or field  
 
techniques that assist in the process of inquiry. These capacities of inquiry are fundamental  
 
in building all the five Aims – Rational Thought and Autonomy, Health and Well-being, and  
 
Democratic/Economic/Cultural participation.
b. Communication. The abilities to listen, speak, read, and write in multiple languages are  
 
very valuable capacities. This includes the skilled use of digital media for effective and  
 
appropriate communications. The ability to use varied forms of communication in different  
 
contexts and that are appropriate for the intended audience is very valuable for all the Aims. 
c. Problem Solving and Logical Reasoning. The ability to formulate problems, develop many  
 
alternative solutions, evaluate different solutions to choose the most optimal solution, and  
 
implement the solution is very valuable. Problems that require quantitative models require  
27
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part A
 
the mastery of various mathematical procedures starting from simple arithmetic skills of  
 
addition and subtraction to more complex solving of algebraic equations. The use of  
 
computational models for solving problems would require computational skills. Skills for  
 
logical reasoning include constructing and evaluating arguments both formally and  
 
informally.   
 
Skills of effective communication, problem-solving and logical reasoning promote  
 
democratic and economic participation. 
d. Aesthetic and Cultural Capacities. The Aims emphasise creativity and aesthetic and  
 
artistic expression. Creating works of art require skills specific to different forms of 
 
art – visual arts, music, dance/movement, and theatre. Culturally relevant skills in art forms  
 
enable effective cultural participation. These skills enable students to effectively express  
 
emotions and thoughts through art, thus improving their sense of health and well-being. 
e. Capacities for Health, Sustenance, and Work. Developing skills and practices that enable  
 
students to lead a healthy life is one of the important Aims. Developing strength, endurance,  
 
and perseverance is not just in terms of physical capacities but also related to capacities of  
 
the mind. Such capacities are foundational for not just well-being but also contribute  
 
positively towards autonomy and democratic participation. Vocational exposure and skills  
 
are given equal importance in NEP 2020 along with academic streams. These capacities  
 
along with the disposition of positive work ethic should enable students to participate in the  
 
economy meaningfully and significantly.
f. Capacities for Social Engagement. Empathy and compassion are not mere values or  
 
dispositions, these are capacities that are developed through deliberate practice.  
 
Cooperation, teamwork, and leadership are fundamental capacities for social engagement.   
 
Along with the capacities for logical reasoning and problem solving these capacities are  
 
crucial for democratic participation.
With the desirable values and dispositions and equipped with appropriate capacities it is 
expected that students will live healthy autonomous lives and participate actively in the 
democracy, economy, and culture. But these values and capacities do not operate in a vacu-
um, they are based on a clear understanding of the world. This understanding is gained 
through achievement of knowledge in breadth and depth.
1.3.3 Knowledge
The achievement of the values and capacities listed above intrinsically depends on knowledge. 
Knowledge about the self, about others, about the social world around us, and the natural world 
enables us in being “capable of rational thought and action”. 
This knowledge has been developed over history through specific modes of inquiry, within a 
community of inquirers. The theories and concepts within a mode of inquiry has emerged some-
times through systematic and incremental explorations of a whole community, and sometimes 
through dramatic insights of a few remarkable individuals. This accumulated knowledge is a 
human heritage, and it is the responsibility of schools to share this heritage with every new gen-
eration.
28
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part A
But this knowledge “is not one seamless robe, but a coat of many colours”. It is a sum of many 
parts. Each part being a specific ‘form of understanding’. Each form of understanding has its 
own community of inquirers who have formed conventions on the scope of inquiry (what ques-
tions to explore), they have their own specific ways of giving meaning to concepts and specific 
methods of validating the truth of the claims being made. They have distinct methods of reason-
ing and justification, procedures and protocols, and what is to be admitted as evidence. In a way, 
each form of understanding has their own kind of ‘critical thinking’ and their own ways of being 
‘creative’.  Mathematics, the Sciences, the Social Sciences, Arts and Aesthetics, and Ethics are some 
of these forms of understanding that have their own set of concepts and theories through which 
we make meaning of our experiences. These forms of understanding give clear direction as to 
what is the knowledge that all students in schools should acquire. They help, in part, in deter-
mining the different Curricular Areas of the NCF.
Through engagement with these forms of understanding, students develop disciplinary knowl-
edge. While the capacity for problem solving depends heavily on such disciplinary knowledge, 
often real-life situations pose problems, solutions for which are informed by many disciplines 
that need to be integrated. For instance, the problems of sustainability and climate change are 
not merely informed by the Sciences, but also by our understanding of Social Sciences and Math-
ematics. Thus, along with these forms of understanding, engagement with interdisciplinary 
knowledge becomes an important goal for school education.

Section 1.4 
 Towards a Curriculum
Schools need to make arrangements to develop in students the desirable values and dispositions, 
capacities, and knowledge through which the aims of education are achieved. As mentioned be-
fore, these arrangements can range from selection and appointment of teachers to school cul-
ture, to the actual subjects that are taught in the school. The curriculum is one part of these ar-
rangements that has a more direct engagement and impact on the learning of the students. While 
the curricular imagination for a school is usually restricted to the arrangements of classroom 
interactions, the school culture and ethos and school practices have a very important role both 
in enabling a positive learning environment, as well as promoting the desirable values and dis-
positions.   
Thus, a curriculum is a deliberate and explicit set of choices of organizing the school experience 
for students that are related to direct teaching-learning experiences in different curricular areas 
as well as the overall school culture and ethos and school processes.
In this section we would explore the specific curricular arrangements schools have to organize 
so that students gain the desirable values and dispositions, capacities, and knowledge.
1.4.1 School Culture
To begin with, it has to be acknowledged that schools achieve aims not just through teaching 
within the confines of the classroom but also through socialization of the students into the extant 
culture and ethos of the school. Values and dispositions in particular are learnt by immersion in 
a school ethos and culture that deliberately and explicitly promotes these values. So, it is equally 
important for a curriculum framework to explicitly articulate the arrangements and organiza-
tion of the school in terms of its culture and ethos that would promote the desirable values and 
disposition. This NCF has made specific recommendations for school culture and ethos in Chap-
ter 15.
1.4.2 School Processes
In addition to school culture, more formal and well-defined school processes have a significant 
role to play in both ensuring smooth functioning of the school as well as enabling achievement of 
curricular goals. Processes for maintaining academic accountability towards achieving the aims, 
both from the teachers and students are important to be articulated, understood, and followed. 
From simple matters like maintaining cleanliness of the school premises, to more complex situ-
ations like responding to learning failures of students, needs thoughtfully designed school pro-
cesses that are transparent, professional, and effective. The NCF makes specific recommenda-
tions related to school processes in Chapter 16.

– குறள்  392
The twain that lore of numbers and of letters give
Are eyes, the wise declare, to all on earth that live 
– Translation, G.U. Pope
Ancient Indians had clear conceptions on what is valuable in education. As the above 
couplet from the ancient Tamil poet Tiruvalluvar indicates, language and mathematics 
were seen as two eyes through which we make sense of the world. It is not surprising 
then, that language and mathematics continue to be important and curricular areas even 
after two thousand years since this verse was written!
Based on the aims, and on the derived knowledge, capacities, and values and dispositions, the 
curriculum is divided into specific curricular areas. This division is not just a pragmatic necessi-
ty for organizing classrooms, timetables, and teachers. While pragmatic considerations are 
equally relevant, the division of the curricular areas have an internal logic. 
1. Languages: Language is not just a medium of thinking, nor merely a tool for acquiring 
different forms of understanding. Language education makes effective communication 
possible and equally develops aesthetic expression and appreciation. Reasoning and critical 
thinking are very closely linked with language use, and these are valuable capacities to be 
developed. In the context of India, multilingualism and sensitivity to a diverse set of 
languages are desirable outcomes as articulated in the NEP 2020.   
The form of understanding, as articulated in the previous section, implies that Mathematics, Sci-
ences, Social Sciences, and Arts form their own distinct curricular areas.
2. Mathematics:  Mathematics is a form of understanding the world through patterns,  
 
measurement, and quantities. Mathematics education also develops capacities for problem-
solving and logical reasoning. 
3. Sciences: Science is a form of understanding the natural world. It has its own specific 
methods of inquiry and reasoning, and theories and concepts. Beyond aiding in gaining 
understanding of the natural phenomena around us, science education helps developing 
rational thought and scientific temper. 
4. Social Sciences: Social Science is a form of understanding the social (human) world. The 
methods of inquiry in Social Science are evidence based and through specific methods of 
reasoning. Like the Sciences, Social Science too promotes rational thought and scientific 
temper. Social Science also enables students in more effective democratic participation.  
5. Arts: Arts is a form of understanding through which we make aesthetic sense of our 
experiences. Engagement with arts also builds our capacities for being creative and 
develops cultural sensibilities. A grounded learning of the arts allows to engage and 
participate meaningfully in our culture and develops capacities for maintaining good health 
and contributes to well-being.
31
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part A
While forms of understanding give disciplinary knowledge and depth, it has been argued earlier 
that interdisciplinary knowledge and thinking is an important goal.
6. Interdisciplinary Areas: Engagement in interdisciplinary areas develops capacities for 
interdisciplinary thinking and problem solving. This curricular area complements the 
disciplinary thinking developed through engagement with specific forms of understanding. 
Beyond these forms of understanding, physical education and vocational education are import-
ant Curricular Areas. These areas become important due the specific Curricular Aims of health 
and well-being and economic participation. The NEP 2020 has given specific directions for both 
physical and vocation education.   
7. Physical Education: Physical Education is focused towards developing capacities for 
maintaining health and well-being. Through engagement in sports, important ethical and 
moral values and Constitutional and democratic values are developed. 
8. Vocational Education: Vocational Education intends to develop capacities for sustenance 
and work and economic participation. It also develops values and sensibilities towards 
physical work and dignity of labour. The NEP 2020 has given a strong emphasis on giving 
vocational exposure and developing vocational skills from very early stages of school 
through to higher education. 
These eight curricular areas have their own specific learning standards, and have specific recom-
mendations for content selection, pedagogical approaches, and ways of assessments. These de-
tails have been outlined in Chapters 6 to 13.

(For reference)
DNEP 2019, Curricular integration of essential subjects and skills
The DNEP 2019, recognizes the limitation of the current educational practice in the 
Indian context. It attempts to shift the focus of the vision of schooling from an excessive 
emphasis on remembering facts, to developing capacities and skills for thinking and 
acting.  The following ten capacities and skills are highlighted as important goals of 
school education, which need to be paid adequate attention, along with other critical 
goals:
a. Develop a scientific temper. “Inculcate scientific temper and encourage evidence-based 
thinking throughout the curriculum: Evidence-based reasoning and the scientiﬁc method 
will be incorporated throughout the school curriculum - in science as well as in 
traditionally “non-science” subjects - in order to encourage rational, analytical, logical, 
and quantitative thinking in all aspects of the curriculum.” [DNEP 2019, 4.6.1.1]
b. Develop creativity and innovation through arts. “Any education emphasising 
creativity and innovation must include the arts.” [DNEP 2019, 4.6.2] Art education in 
music, “theatre, poetry, painting, drawing, sculpture, and vocational arts such as 
carpentry, embroidery/sewing/clothes-making” [DNEP 2019, 4.6.2.1] should develop 
aesthetic capacities and sensibilities.
c. Develop excellent verbal and written communication capacities. The education 
system should develop “the ability to speak, listen, question, discuss, and write with clarity 
and conciseness – and with conﬁdence, eloquence, friendliness, and open-mindedness…” 
[DNEP 2019, 4.6.3].
d. Develop appropriate practices and habits to maintain a healthy body and mind. 
“Physical education is important for both physical and mental health and development. It 
helps improve a child’s muscular and cardiovascular strength, ﬂexibility, endurance, 
motor skills, and mind-body connection and wellness.” [DNEP 2019, 4.6.4]. In addition, a 
good sports programme “helps students develop the qualities of teamwork, cooperation, 
problem-solving, discipline, perseverance, and responsibility” [ibid]. 
e. Develop effective problem-solving and logical reasoning capacities. Developing 
positive dispositions of seeing challenges as problems to be solved and capacities to find 
solutions to those problems is an important aim of school education. “Just as exercising 
the body is important to keep it ﬁt and healthy, so too is exercising the mind. Games of 
strategy, logic and word puzzles, and recreational mathematics are the best way to excite 
children about mathematics, and to develop the logical skills that are so critical 
throughout their school years and indeed throughout life” [DNEP 2019, 4.6.5] 
f. Develop useful vocational skills and sensibilities. “Vocational education is extremely 
vital for our country to run efﬁciently and properly, and thus it is beneﬁcial to 
increasingly incorporate elements of vocational education into the school curriculum to 
expose children to its utility and its value as art. Indeed, some exposure to practical 
vocational-style training is always fun for young students, and for many students it may 
offer a glimpse of future professions while for others it would at the very least help teach 
and reinforce the dignity of all labour.” [DNEP 2019, 4.6.6]. 
33
National Curriculum Framework for School Education

g. Develop digital literacy and computational thinking. “The new curriculum will also 
integrate digital literacy for all learners at the basic level, with hands-on assessments and 
worksheets keeping in mind the available digital infrastructure on the ground. At a more 
advanced level, curricula will be developed for Computational thinking …and 
Programming… “[DNEP 2019, 4.6.7] 
h. Develop capacities for moral reasoning and ethical action. “Introducing an “ethics” 
component to the curriculum early on and throughout the years of school is also 
considered extremely important in helping students to build character, grow up into 
moral and good human beings, lead productive and happy lives, and contribute positively 
to society.” [DNEP 2019, 4.6.8].
i. Develop an in-depth understanding of Indian knowledge systems. “Indian 
contributions to knowledge and the contexts in which they were discovered must be 
incorporated into the school curriculum not just for reasons of historical accuracy (which 
is sufﬁcient reason on its own), but also for the often more holistic nature of the 
traditional Indian approach which leads to a deeper understanding, as well as for 
reasons of increased relatability due to geographic location, national pride, inspiration, 
and self-esteem.” [DNEP 2019, 4.6.9] 
j. Develop capacities and dispositions to be engaged with current affairs. Keeping 
abreast with current affairs, linking the knowledge gained in the school with the realities 
outside, and participating in current issues and debates are important characteristics of 
a responsible citizen. Schools should have dynamic content that “involve talking about the 
current economic scenario, recent scientiﬁc inventions, advances in medicine, geopolitical 
power equations around the world, trends in art and music, gender issues, environmental 
concerns, etc. - all topics that would have a direct bearing in the future on students’ lives 
and their livelihoods.” [DNEP 2019, 4.6.10]

 School Stages - Logic and 
 Design
The previous chapter has articulated the Aims of School Education for this NCF, and the corre-
sponding set of desirable values and dispositions, capacities, and knowledge required to achieve 
these aims. The chapter also has given justifications for the different Curricular Areas that are 
parts of the NCF. These aims are to be achieved in a 5+3+3+4 structure in school education cov-
ering ages 3-18. 
The NEP 2020 recommends that schooling should be imagined in four stages in a new 5+3+3+4 
design covering ages 3-18. “The curricular and pedagogical structure and the curricular frame-
work for school education will therefore be guided by a 5+3+3+4 design, consisting of the Founda-
tional Stage (in two parts, that is, 3 years of Anganwadi/pre-school + 2 years in primary school in 
Grades 1-2; both together covering ages 3-8), Preparatory Stage (Grades 3-5, covering ages 8-11), 
Middle Stage (Grades 6-8, covering ages 11-14), and Secondary Stage (Grades 9-12 in two phases, 
i.e., 9 and 10 in the first and 11 and 12 in the second, covering ages 14-18).” [NEP 2020, 4.1]
This chapter outlines the logic of these four stages of schooling, on how each of these stages has 
specific considerations for curricular structure, content, pedagogy, and assessments and their 
relevance for achieving the aims of school education.
The central logic of dividing schooling into the four stages is based on our current understanding 
of child development and the growth of concepts in different curricular areas. The first two sec-
tions describe the process and stages of child development and concept development. The last 
section elaborates on the four-stage design of NCF.

 Child Development
Around the world, the experiences of children growing up are different, depending on various 
circumstances – social, cultural, and economic. But there are some common processes and stages 
too in the maturation and growth of the child. It is critically important to understand the devel-
opment of a child to have realistic expectations at a particular age. In the field of education real-
ising the significance of child development leads to the development of a quality curriculum with 
developmentally appropriate pedagogy and assessment. 
Child development is influenced by the interplay of three different processes namely biological 
processes, cognitive processes, and socio-emotional processes. Biological, cognitive, and socio-
emotional processes are intricately interwoven with each other. Each of these processes plays a 
role in the development of a child whose body and mind are interdependent.

National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part A
A child’s development is usually described in terms of periods corresponding to approximate age 
ranges. 
1. Infancy: This period ranges from birth to 24 months of age. A child in this period is highly 
dependent on adults. Children are beginning to learn about the things around them, learn to 
focus their vision and explore. 
2. Early childhood: This period begins around 3 and usually extends up to 6-7 years of age. 
Children begin to become more self-sufficient and spend more time with peers. This is also 
a period of intense exploration through play. 
3. Middle to late childhood: This developmental period is from 6-7 years to 10-11 years of 
age before they hit puberty. During this period children master the fundamental capacities 
and understanding for survival and growth. They grow physically, emotionally, and 
cognitively through exposure to the wider world around them and their culture.
4. Adolescence: This period is the transition period from childhood to early adulthood. A 
child enters adolescence at approximately the age of 12 years. Adolescence begins with 
rapid physical changes – gains in height and weight, changes in body contour and 
development of sexual characteristics. At this stage, the development of identity and the 
quest for independence is the central theme in children.  
2.1.1 Development across domains
2.1.1.1 
Physical Development 
Height and weight increase rapidly during infancy. By their first birthday, they nearly triple their 
weight. As the child reaches early childhood the percentage of height and weight decreases 
with each additional year. Growth patterns vary individually where much of the variation is due 
to hereditary but also certain environmental factors can influence it to some extent such as nu-
trition. Middle and late childhood is the calm before the rapid growth spurt in adolescence. It 
involves slow and consistent growth in height and weight. There is improved muscle tone, and 
the strength capacity also doubles during these years. After slowing through childhood, adoles-
cence experiences a growth surge during puberty. Puberty occurs approximately two years ear-
lier for girls than boys. The features and proportions of the body changes as the individual be-
come capable of reproduction. Among the most important factors that influence the onset and 
sequence of puberty are heredity, hormones, weight, and body fat.
Sensory and motor development: Infants and children develop rolling, sitting, standing and 
other motor skills in a particular sequence and within specific time frames. Infants are also born 
with certain reflexes which are built-in reactions to stimuli. Reflexes govern the new-born’s 
movements, which are automatic and beyond the new-born’s control. Reflexes are genetically 
carried survival mechanisms. They allow infants to respond adaptively to their environment be-
fore they have had an opportunity to learn. They include the sucking, rooting, and moro reflexes 
(when the baby gets started by an unexpected sound, light, or movement), all of which typically 
disappear after three to four months. Some reflexes, such as blinking and yawning, persist 
throughout life; components of other reflexes are incorporated into voluntary actions. 
39
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part A
Gross motor skills involve large-muscle activities. Key skills developed during infancy include 
control of posture and walking. Mastering a motor skill requires the infant’s active efforts to co-
ordinate several components of the skill. Infants explore and select possible solutions to the de-
mands of a new task; they assemble adaptive patterns by modifying their current movement 
patterns. Gross motor skills improve dramatically during the childhood years. Boys usually out-
perform girls in gross motor skills involving large-muscle activity. 
Fine motor skills involve finely tuned movements. The onset of reaching and grasping is a sig-
nificant accomplishment. Fine motor skills continue to develop throughout the childhood years 
and by 4 years of age are much more precise. Children can use their hands as tools by middle 
childhood, and at 10 to 12 years of age start to show fine motor skills similar to those of adults.
2.1.1.2 
Cognitive Development
Children construct their own cognitive worlds, building mental structures to adapt to the world. 
They actively construct their meaning and understanding. The progression of cognitive develop-
ment from infancy to adolescent can be seen as described below.
Infancy: The infant organizes and coordinates sensory experiences (such as seeing and hearing) 
with physical movements. They quickly learn and are able to understand that things they see 
continue to exist even though these things are no longer around them. They can scan patterns 
actively and display a growing capacity for remembering in ways that current neuroscience is 
still exploring.
Early Childhood: The child’s mental life is becoming more expansive with experiences. They 
have pictures in their minds about various things in the world. Their capacity for new vocabulary 
and making mental pictures allows for more learning about the world and other people. They 
have begun to make sense of others, getting a sense of how people and things work. Their mem-
ories can hold much more than adults give them credit for!
Middle Childhood: By now, the child can think through reasons using language and ideas, un-
derstand well how people and things work around them, and give order to these things in terms 
of value and size. Their capacity to remember and use what they remember to do activities is 
growing in leaps and bounds. They even devise ways to remember better and are able to analyse, 
problem-solve, imagine alternatives.
Adolescence: The adolescent individual thinks in diverse and complex ways with a growing ca-
pacity for working with ideas and logical analysis. This enables them to plan, solve problems, and 
systematically test solutions. They are able to mentally look back at their own actions and evalu-
ate, are forming a sense of themselves as different and similar to others, able to engage with 
ideas of right and wrong. They can be focused and flexible in their thinking and make decisions 
with reasoning.
40
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part A
2.1.1.3 
Language Development
The development of language is a significant aspect of a child’s development. The trajectory of 
this development across the age ranges is described below.
Infancy: Among the milestones in infant language development are crying (birth), cooing (1 to 2 
months), babbling (6 months), using gestures (8 to 12 months), recognition of their name (as 
early as 5 months), first word spoken (10 to 15 months), vocabulary spurt (18 months), rapid 
expansion of understanding words (18 to 24 months), and two-word utterances (18 to 24 
months).
Early Childhood: Young children increase their grasp of language’s rule systems. In terms of 
phonology, most young children become more sensitive to the sounds of spoken language. Chil-
dren learn and apply rules of syntax and of how words should be ordered. Vocabulary develop-
ment increases dramatically during early childhood, conversational skills improve. They increase 
their sensitivity to the needs of others in conversation, and they learn to change their speech 
style to suit the situation.
Middle Childhood: Children gradually become more analytical and logical in their approach to 
words and grammar. They become increasingly able to use complex grammar and produce nar-
ratives that make sense. Improvements in metalinguistic awareness - knowledge about language 
- become evident as children start defining words, expand their knowledge of syntax, and under-
stand better how to use language in culturally appropriate ways.
Adolescence: In adolescence, language changes include more effective use of words; improve-
ments in the ability to understand metaphor, satire, and adult literary works; and improvements 
in writing. Young adolescents often speak a dialect with their peers, using jargon and slang.
2.1.1.4 
Socio-emotional Development
A child’s socioemotional development impacts the other domains of development. Physical, Cog-
nitive and language development is highly influenced by how children feel about themselves and 
how they are able to express their ideas and emotions.
a. Emotional and Personality Development
Infancy: Emotions are the first language with which parents and infants communicate, and 
emotions play key roles in parent-child relationships. Infants display a number of emotions 
early in their development. Crying is the most important mechanism new-borns have for com-
municating with the people in their world.
Early Childhood: Advances in young children’s emotional development involve expressing 
emotions, understanding emotions, and regulating emotions. Young children’s range of emo-
tions expands during early childhood as they increasingly experience self-conscious emotions 
such as pride, shame, and guilt. They also show a growing awareness of the need to manage 
emotions to meet social standards.
Middle Childhood: Self-understanding increasingly involves social and psychological charac-
teristics, including social comparison. The development of self-regulation is an important as-
41
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part A
pect of this stage. Developmental changes in emotion include increased understanding of 
complex emotions such as pride and shame, improvements in the ability to suppress and con-
ceal negative emotions, and the use of strategies to redirect feelings. Children use a greater 
variety of coping strategies.
Adolescence: Identity development is complex and takes place in bits and pieces. Some re-
searchers have found that self-esteem declines in early adolescence for both boys and girls, 
but the drop for girls is greater. Self-esteem reflects perceptions that do not always match re-
ality. 
b. Role of Families
Infancy: In infancy, contact comfort and trust are important in the development of attach-
ment. Infants show a strong interest in their social world and are motivated to understand it. 
Infants orient to the social world early in their development.
Early Childhood: Families play a significant role in the socio-emotional development of the 
child. The child takes emotional cues from the families and the socio-emotional state in the 
family interactions. The sense of emotional security and comfort in interactions largely de-
pend on family environment.
Middle Childhood: Children begin to form strong bonds with peers, while families continue 
to play a significant role in their emotional development. The socio-emotional state of peer 
groups and social groups have a strong influence on the child’s socio-emotional dispositions.
Adolescence: There is a significant shift in the influence of peers. Identity formation, rebel-
ling against authority, conflict, aggression are some markers of this age. Families’ influence is 
significantly lower on socio-emotional development, but the way conflicts are handled within 
the family has a significant impact.
c. Role of Peers
Early Childhood: Peers are powerful socialization agents. Peers provide a source of informa-
tion and comparison about the world outside the family. In early childhood, children distin-
guish between friends and nonfriends, with a friend often described as someone to play with. 
Rough-and-tumble play is more likely to occur in peer relations, whereas in times of stress 
children often turn to parents rather than peers for support.
Middle Childhood: Children form stronger bonds with peers that goes beyond play. Friend-
ships are formed and friend groups become an important source for emotional development. 
Children continue to seek confirmation from adults both at home and in school.
Adolescence: There is a significant shift in the influence of peers. Identity formation, rebel-
ling against authority, conflict, aggression are some markers. Families’ influence is significant-
ly lower on socio-emotional development, but the way conflicts are handled within the family 
has a significant impact. Fitting in and receiving confirmation from peer groups is a high pri-

Moral Development
Infancy: Their sense of right and wrong depends on their feelings and desires. Their sense of 
rightness depends on whether their needs are met or not.
Early Childhood: Children think of justice and rules as unchangeable properties of the world 
and beyond the control of people. They judge the rightness of behaviour by considering the con-
sequences and not intentions of the individual.
Middle Childhood: Children begin to express objective ideas on fairness. Children believe that 
equity can mean that people with special needs or merit need special treatment.
Adolescence: Closer to adulthood children begin to develop their own moral values while ques-
tioning and analysing the ones set by their parents or the society. They value rules but also nego-
tiate. As they develop abstract reasoning abilities, they display interest in larger good for the 
society.
Box A-2.1-i
Panchakosha Vikas (Five-fold Development) - A keystone in Indian tradition
The child is a whole being with panchakoshas 
or five sheaths. The layers are 
annamaya kosha (physical layer), 
pranamaya kosha (life force energy 
layer), manomaya kosha (mind 
layer), vijnanamaya kosha (intellec-
tual layer) and anandamaya kosha 
(inner self). Each layer exhibits 
certain distinct characteristics. The 
holistic development of a child takes 
into account the nurturing and 
nourishment of these five layers.
Specific types of practices are de-
signed to enable the development of 
each of these koshas. However, the 
practices are designed keeping in 
mind that the koshas are intercon-
nected and so activities that focus 
primarily on one would also 
contribute to the development of the others. 
For example, the physical dimensions are developed through a focus on a balanced diet, 
traditional games, and adequate exercise, as well as yoga asanas (at the appropriate ages), 
which build both gross and fine motor skills. Learning to breathe in a way that provides 
necessary oxygen for the entire body is important; it, trains the voice, and provides direction 
for increased self-awareness. A wide variety of stories, songs, lullabies, poems, prayer, enable 
children to not only develop a love for their cultural context but also provide value-based 
insights. This contributes to language development beginning with listening or shravana as 
43

well as the ability to focus and concentrate. The senses, indriyas, are to be sharpened to be 
able to experience the world around in all its beauty and wonder. Seva integrated into 
everyday life enables the experience of joy of relationships along with being a part of and 
doing good for one’s community.
The Panchakosha concept and imagination also maps into the different domains of develop-
ment envisaged in ECCE which are the basis of the Curricular Goals as discussed in the next 
Chapter.
• Physical Development (Sharirik Vikas): Age-specific balanced physical development, 
physical fitness, flexibility, strength, and endurance; development of senses; nutrition, 
hygiene, personal health, expansion of physical abilities; building body and habits keeping 
in mind one hundred years of healthy living in a human being.
• Development of Life Energy (Pranik Vikas): Balance and retention of energy, positive 
energy and enthusiasm, smooth functioning of all major systems (digestive, respiratory, 
circulatory, and nervous systems) by activation of the sympathetic and parasympathetic 
nervous system.
• Emotional/Mental Development (Manasik Vikas): Concentration, peace, will and will 
power, courage, handling negative emotions, developing virtues (maulyavardhan), the 
will to attach and detach from work, people and situations, happiness, visual and 
performing arts, culture, and literature.
• Intellectual Development (Bauddhik Vikas): Observation, experimentation, analytical 
ability, abstract and divergent thinking, synthesis, logical reasoning, linguistic skills, 
imagination, creativity, power of discrimination, generalization, and abstraction.
• Spiritual Development (Chaitsik Vikas): Happiness, love and compassion, spontaneity, 
freedom, aesthetic sense, the journey of ‘turning the awareness inwards.’
Panchakosha is an ancient explication of the importance of the body-mind complex in 
human experience and understanding. This non-dichotomous approach to human develop-
ment gives clear pathways and direction towards a more holistic education.

Section 2.2 
Concept Development
While child development describes the process of growth and maturation of children in different 
domains, the nature of knowledge and capacities also have some implications on the sequence in 
which concepts and skills are learnt. This section explores some of these sequences and their 
implication for the four stages of schooling.
2.2.1 Literacy Development
Reading and writing have become very central to education and schooling. Most of the learning 
materials whether in the form of textbooks or worksheets have printed text in them and the  
students are expected to read and comprehend them. So, it is important to consider the stages of 
reading development for the design of the School Stages. Reading develops in the following   stag-
es :
1. Stage 0: Pre-reading: Children develop oral language capacities and begin to recognize 
individual sounds in parts of speech. If they are from a literate home context, they have an 
emerging understanding of the uses of texts.
2. Stage 1: Initial Reading: Children start making connections between oral sounds and the 
visual symbolic form of the written system. This aspect of reading is termed as ‘decoding’ 
where the effort is focussed on establishing letter-sound relationships and using this 
understanding to read familiar and unfamiliar words. 
3. Stage 2: Fluency and Ungluing from Print: Their decoding abilities become fluent and 
thus placing low cognitive demand on the process of converting the textual symbols to 
sounds. With the release of this burden their focus shifts to grasping the meaning in the 
text.
4. Stage 3: Reading for Learning the New: In this stage children are not just reading familiar 
texts and engaging with familiar ideas in a textual form. They are able to learn new ideas 
and concepts through the process of reading. They are not relying only on their concrete 
physical experience but are able to imagine possibilities based on what they read. Reaching 
this stage is especially important for students to become independent learners.
5. Stage 4: Multiple Viewpoints: In this stage a more critical understanding of the text being 
read becomes possible. The students can understand that the author of the text has a 
specific viewpoint and there are possible other viewpoints. They can bring in their own 
understanding and critically evaluate the piece of text. 
6. Stage 5: Constructions and Reconstruction: The reader forms a worldview based on 
what they are reading. They consciously choose books to further deepen their worldview or 
to challenge the worldview they hold. They are able to identify the core thesis of the 
authors, identify their agreements and disagreements with that thesis and are able to 
synthesize and construct a new thesis through this process. 
In this approach to stages of reading, by the end of the Preparatory Stage, students should be 
reaching Stage 2 and by end of the Middle Stage, they are at Stage 3 and in the Secondary Stage 
they achieve Stage 4 and are beginning in Stage 5. 
45

2.2.2 Perceptual, Practical, and Theoretical Concepts
Perceptual concepts are concepts formed through our perception or senses. Very young chil-
dren can start differentiating objects based on their colour, shape, texture, and perhaps even 
taste and smell. More complex concepts like, birds have feathers, and dogs have legs and bark are 
perceptual concepts too. They are formed through careful observation and the use of the senses. 
Children almost automatically form these concepts through their experiences. By giving names 
to objects and experiences language does play an important role in developing and expressing 
these concepts. 
Practical concepts are concepts formed not just by the perceptions but the practical use that is 
embedded. For e.g., a table or a chair is not a mere perception of the colour or shape of the object 
but the practical use of the object. While the chair is an object on which people sit, a table is not 
usually used for sitting, but rather to put objects on it or use for work. To form practical concepts, 
children need to have some understanding of social life. To understand a practical concept, one 
must grasp what people do with an object, and what they use it for . Again, through engagement 
and exposure to exercises in practical life, children develop practical concepts. 
Language development plays a very important role in the development of perceptual and practi-
cal concepts. Language enables us to check our experiences with others and to ensure we have a 
shared meaning emerging from these experiences. Thus, making sure that we grasp the socially 
accepted use of the practical concept or the socially accepted vocabulary that represents the 
perceptual concept.
Theoretical concepts on the other hand explore in highly systematic ways our ordinary ‘com-
mon sense’ experience. These concepts make sense only within a form of understanding. While 
a spherical shape or a rectangular shape can be perceived, the mathematical understanding of a 
sphere or a rectangle has a very precise meaning. A rupee coin might perceptually mean a shiny 
round object. The practical use of it can also be grasped. But to understand money as an econom-
ic concept needs an introduction to a whole lot of theories and conceptual structures in econom-
ics. 
While perceptual and practical concepts require not much more than a normal intuitive mind, 
theoretical concepts often are counterintuitive. To grasp that the earth is rotating around the sun 
at 30 kilometres per second and we are standing on a spinning orb spinning at the speed of 460 
meters per second we cannot rely on our perceptions, nor can ordinary practical experience be 
of any assistance. We need an understanding of physics and mathematics. There is often a dis-
continuity between our intuitions and ordinary practices and the nature of reality. 
Thus, theoretical concepts cannot be acquired merely through experiences or learning by doing. 
They need a more deliberate attempt of the Teacher and the student to grasp the meaning behind 
the experience by connecting it to various conceptual structures and the methods of inquiry 
specific to a form of understanding.
This indicates that very young children can grasp and develop perceptual and practical concepts 
through experience and human interaction along with effective use of language. Theoretical con-
cepts on the other hand make sense only through the introduction of a form of understanding 
46

and perhaps can wait till the Middle Stage. In the Secondary Stage, students gain deeper disci-
plinary knowledge and methods. This should enable them to grasp the deeper meanings of the 
theoretical concepts, by placing the concept within the overall conceptual framework of the 
disciplines, explaining them using the current valid theories of the discipline, and also by linking 
these concepts to theoretical concepts in other disciplines.
47

Section 2.3 
Modes of Inquiry
Beyond the nature of knowledge and growth in capacities for literacy, the modes of inquiry used 
by children to develop conceptual understanding play a very important role in the selection of 
content, pedagogy, and assessment. The progression of these modes of inquiry also has implica-
tions for the stages of schooling.
2.3.1 
2.3.1.1 
Play and Exploration
Young children learn various concepts, particularly perceptual and practical concepts, largely 
through play and open exploration. Their incredibly curious and absorbent minds are constantly 
exploring the natural and social world around them. They are intuitive problem solvers and 
grasp conventions of language use and social behaviour through observation and imitation. At 
this stage, a stimulating environment and the freedom to explore and play are the biggest and 
most effective sources of learning. The stimulation doesn’t come only from the material environ-
ment but also from an attentive and active adult and peer group. 
2.3.1.2 
Capacities for Inquiry
From a broad and free exploration, children need to acquire more specific capacities that have an 
important role in further inquiry. In addition to the foundational capacities of literacy and nu-
meracy, they acquire skills in observation, data collection, analysis, and more. Gross motor skills 
and fine motor skills relevant to physical education and arts, and vocational education are devel-
oped. Further, capacities for attention, perseverance, and memory are also developed. These ca-
pacities are utilized in informal methods of inquiry to make sense of the world around them and 
to respond to the practical necessities of life. These capacities can be developed by giving learn-
ing experiences that are practical and within the social context of the student. The opportunities 
for learning can be guided explorations with the specific intent to develop these capacities. 
2.3.1.3 
Methods for Inquiry
To gain a deeper understanding, particularly of theoretical concepts, students need to gain 
knowledge and capacities for specific methods of inquiry. These methods are particular to differ-
ent forms of understanding. Mathematics, Science, and Social Science have their own methods of 
inquiry and logic of reasoning. They have specific theories, and a web of concepts, the under-
standing of which gives insight into a new way of thinking about the world. These methods, the-
ories and concepts increase the depth of inquiry within a specific convention or tradition.
Similarly, Arts has its specific forms and traditions in visual arts, music, dance, and theatre. Un-
derstanding these forms and acquiring the relevant practices, enables the students for a deeper 
exploration of aesthetic experiences. Specific forms of sports and practices like yoga have their 
own methods. 
By getting introduced to these methods, students gain capacities for systematic and rigorous 
methods of inquiry in specific forms of understanding. 
48
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part A
Teaching, in this stage, is more formal and the emphasis is on understanding the conventions and 
the “rules of the game” of each form of understanding, and the necessary capacity to “play” with-
in these “rules”.
2.3.1.4 
Disciplinary Exploration
In this stage, students gain disciplinary depth within each form of understanding. The mode of 
inquiry becomes exploratory again like in the first stage, but within a framework of a discipline 
or a form. For e.g., a student with sufficient capacities/skills for dancing and a grounded knowl-
edge of Bharatanatyam as a form of dance can now use these capacities and knowledge for cre-
ative expressions through dance. Similarly, in after gaining sufficient capacities for scientific in-
quiry through experimentation and instrumentation in Biology, students can pursue interesting 
and challenging questions about life forms and attempt to answer these questions within the 
discipline of Biology. A more sophisticated form of exploration would be to utilize their knowl-
edge in multiple disciplines and approach problems with interdisciplinary solutions.  
 
49

Section 2.4 
Stage Design
The curriculum for the four stages of schooling has been designed based on the vision of NEP and 
on the considerations of child development, conceptual development, and the appropriate modes 
of inquiry at each age range. 
2.4.1 Foundational Stage
The Foundation Stage is for children of the age 3 to 8. Children start schooling in the Foundation-
al Stage. The design is based on the principles of Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE).
“ECCE ideally consists of flexible, multi-faceted, multi-level, play-based, activity-based, and inqui-
ry-based learning, comprising of alphabets, languages, numbers, counting, colours, shapes, indoor 
and outdoor play, puzzles and logical thinking, problem-solving, drawing, painting and other visual 
art, craft, drama and puppetry, music and movement. It also includes a focus on developing social 
capacities, sensitivity, good behaviour, courtesy, ethics, personal and public cleanliness, teamwork, 
and cooperation. The overall aim of ECCE will be to attain optimal outcomes in the domains of: 
physical and motor development, cognitive development, socio-emotional-ethical development, 
cultural/artistic development, and the development of communication and early language, litera-
cy, and numeracy.” [NEP 2020, 1.2]
• Curricular Structure: The Foundational Stage curriculum of the NCF is divided into domains 
that are closely linked to the developmental domains of the child – physical development, 
socio-emotional-ethical development, cognitive development, language and literacy 
development, and aesthetic and cultural development. These domains of development are 
also informed by the Panchakosha imagination. 
• Content: Textbooks are used only from Grade 1 and most of the content is concrete materials 
– toys, puzzles, and manipulatives. Along with these materials, learning experience 
organized through physical exploration of the classroom and outdoor space becomes the 
most appropriate content. In later years of this stage, worksheets can start playing a bigger 
role. Children’s literature is a very important source of content for language and literacy 
development. 
• Pedagogy: The pedagogical approach suggested is play based and emphasizes the nurturing 
caring relationships between the teacher and the children. The pedagogical design should 
allow for a balance between self-paced individual learning to a more social group-based 
learning. Development of foundational capacities in literacy and numeracy would require 
adequate time for the child to practice and repeat on their own. Whole class instruction 
should be balanced with work time for children where they work on their own either with 
materials or with worksheets. 
• Assessments: Most assessments are observations made by teachers and not explicit testing 
the ability of students. Worksheets used by children can give information to teachers about 
the progress in learning. 
50
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part A
• Classroom Arrangement: Children of this age group need to move freely and have adequate 
opportunities for engaging their natural curiosity and exploration. Classroom arrangements 
should reflect this need of the children and should not restrict the movement of children.  
• Teachers: Since the relationship between children and the teacher is critical for this stage, 
the same teacher would engage in all the domains and there would not be any subject/
domain-specific teacher. The teacher-pupil ratio is also expected to be lower since 
individual attention and assessment through observation are necessary.
The Foundational Stage bridges the divide between the home environment of the child and the 
formal school environment. It develops capacities in Foundational Literacy and Numeracy that 
enables the student to learn all other subject areas. In addition to these capacities, it develops 
valuable dispositions for active learning and would enable the students to become engaged 
learners in formal school environments. Play and exploration are the natural modes through 
which children learn and the Foundational Stage utilizes these modes to promote the valuable 
capacities and dispositions. 
2.4.2 Preparatory Stage
The Preparatory Stage is for three years and includes Grades 3,4, and 5. 
“The Preparatory Stage will comprise three years of education, building on the play-, discovery-, 
and activity-based pedagogical and curricular style of the Foundational Stage, but also gradually 
beginning to incorporate textbooks as well as aspects of more formal classroom learning. There 
would mostly be generalist teachers during this stage, with the possible exception of some specialist 
language and art teachers (who may be shared across the school or school complex). The aim of this 
stage will be to lay the general groundwork across subjects, including reading, writing, speaking, 
physical education, art, languages, science, and mathematics, so that students are prepared to 
delve deeper into learning areas through specialised subjects and subject teachers in the stages 
that follow.” [DNEP 4.1.1]
• Curricular Structure: The Preparatory Stage curriculum of the NCF is divided into the 
following curricular areas – languages, mathematics, arts, physical education, and the world 
around us. The world around us is an interdisciplinary area that encourages exploration 
and understanding of both the natural world and the social world. Aspects of work in 
vocational education are also incorporated into this curricular area. The preparation is 
largely focused on capacities and dispositions at this stage.
• Content: Textbooks start playing a bigger role in the areas of language and mathematics. A 
variety of children’s literature should complement the language textbook to consolidate 
students’ literacy capacities. Materials and manipulatives continue to play a role in 
mathematics, though emphasis shifts to symbolic representation in correspondence with 
concrete materials. The world around us should rely less on the textbook and more on 
experiential learning with physical exploration as the main source of content. The content 
needs to be within the familiar contexts of the student. 
• Pedagogy: The pedagogy continues to be activity-based and discovery-based in this stage, 
gradually encouraging students to be active within a formal classroom arrangement. The 
51
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part A
ability to concentrate and pay continuous attention to classroom lectures and discussions 
needs to be encouraged. Some proportion of the self-paced individual work should be part 
of the classroom activity, while some amount of homework can be included.  
• Assessments: Assessments in this stage is a combination of observation of students’ 
activity, correcting their worksheets and short formal written evaluations. Periodic 
summative assessments should supplement the more formative assessments.  
• Classroom Arrangement: The classroom setting is a balance between a formal 
environment and an arrangement that encourages movement and exploration. Students 
sitting and working in groups should be encouraged.  
• Teachers: Teachers continue to be generalists and teach across curricular areas. For arts 
and physical education, specialists from the school complexes can be invited for the 
development of specific capacities and skills, but the class teacher should continue to be 
present and mediate these interactions with the students.
The Preparatory Stage consolidates the capacities and dispositions that begin to develop in the 
Foundational Stage. Students are expected to develop fluency in literacy and numeracy and de-
velop further capacities that are helpful in a systematic exploration of the natural and social 
worlds around them.  
2.4.3 Middle Stage
The Middle Stage is for three years and includes Grades 6, 7, and 8.
“The Middle Stage will comprise three years of education, building on the pedagogical and curricu-
lar style of the Preparatory Stage, but with the introduction of subject teachers for learning and 
discussion of the more abstract concepts in each subject that students will be ready for at this stage 
across the sciences, mathematics, arts, social sciences, and humanities. Experiential learning within 
each subject, and explorations of relations among different subjects, will be encouraged and em-
phasized despite the introduction of more specialized subjects and subject teachers.” [NEP 2020, 
4.2]
• Curricular Structure: The Middle Stage expands the curricular areas to include the 
Sciences – the study of the natural world, and Social Sciences – the study of the human 
world, and students get exposure to Vocational Education. Based on the capacities and 
dispositions in the Preparatory Stage, students engage more formally with knowledge and 
values in the Middle Stage. Curricular Areas are dealt with as ‘forms of understanding’ with 
explicit engagement with paradigmatic theories and conceptual structures that frame each 
area. The more generic capacities (like observation and data collection) developed in the 
Preparatory Stage are now specialized into specific methods of inquiry that is appropriate 
for each form of understanding. For e.g., students gain an understanding of the scientific 
method of inquiry and also contrast it with methods of inquiry in history or in the arts. The 
conventions and protocols of each form of understanding are also introduced in the middle 
stage. 
52
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part A
• Content: The content in the Middle Stage needs to reflect the engagement with theoretical 
concepts and the introduction of theories and conceptual frameworks specific to each form 
of understanding. There is a shift to more abstract ideas and the students are expected to 
engage with unfamiliar contexts and situations. The textbooks need to play a central role in 
mediating the content in the Middle Stage. Both the expansion of curricular areas and the 
engagement with abstract ideas and unfamiliar contexts could be challenging and 
bewildering for students. Well-designed textbooks with clear expectations and specific 
learning goals would support students in entering these forms of understanding in a 
structured and systematic manner. 
• Pedagogy: Pedagogy is a judicious balance of direct instruction and opportunities for 
exploration and inquiry. As mentioned before, the expansion of content areas and the 
abstract nature of theories places a heavy cognitive demand on students. The focus on 
concept development indicates that the Teacher must pay attention to the prior concepts 
that students might already have and how to use those conceptions to bring about active 
learning. The emphasis is not on accumulating more facts but on becoming fluent in the 
methods of inquiry within each form of understanding. 
• Assessments: Assessments can become more formal and explicit. The focus of assessments 
should be on the specific ways of reasoning within each form of understanding and not 
merely the recall of facts. Formal tests and examinations play a role with the expectation 
that students can process larger chunks of information together for analysis and synthesis.    
• Teachers: Subject-specific teachers handle different curricular areas in this stage. Teachers 
need a profound understanding of the curricular area in terms of both vertical connections 
of concepts within the subject and horizontal connections with concepts in other areas. 
Students of this age benefit from engaging with a diverse set of adults who have their own 
personalities and interests. Arts, physical education, and vocational education can have 
visiting faculty who have specialized knowledge and skills. 
The Middle Stage utilizes the capacities and dispositions developed during the Preparatory 
Stage and introduces the students to different forms of understanding. Students gain systematic 
knowledge through rational thought and enquiry. The capacities for critical thinking and prob-
lem-solving are consolidated in this stage and they acquire the desirable values and dispositions 
for democratic/economic/cultural participation. 
2.4.4 Secondary Stage
The Secondary Stage is for four years and includes Grades 9, 10, 11 and 12.
“The Secondary Stage will comprise of four years of multidisciplinary study, building on the sub-
ject-oriented pedagogical and curricular style of the Middle Stage, but with greater depth, greater 
critical thinking, greater attention to life aspirations, and greater flexibility and student choice of 
subjects. In particular students would continue to have the option of exiting after Grade 10 and 
re-entering in the next phase to pursue vocational or any other courses available in Grades 11-12, 
including at a more specialized school, if so desired.” [NEP 2020, 4.2]
53
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part A
“Students will be given increased flexibility and choice of subjects to study, particularly in second-
ary school - including subjects in physical education, the arts and crafts, and vocational skills – so 
that they can design their own paths of study and life plans. Holistic development and a wide choice 
of subjects and courses year to year will be the new distinguishing feature of secondary school edu-
cation. There will be no hard separation among ‘curricular’, ‘extracurricular’, or ‘co-curricular’, 
among ‘arts’, ‘humanities’, and ‘sciences’, or between ‘vocational’ or ‘academic’ streams. Subjects 
such as physical education, the arts and crafts, and vocational skills, in addition to science, human-
ities, and mathematics, will be incorporated throughout the school curriculum, with a consider-
ation for what is interesting and safe at each age.” [NEP 2020, 4.9]
The implications of the above two policy directions for curriculum design of the Secondary Stage 
are the following:
a. It consists of four years of multidisciplinary study, during which students will be offered a 
range of courses including: 
i. 
Essential courses which all students must take 
ii. 
Choice-based courses which each student may select
iii. Vocational education, arts and sports which will be an integral part of the curriculum
b. The current practice of streaming into science, arts/humanities, and commerce will be 
replaced by a design that enables both breadth through engagement with a variety of 
courses across streams and depth in areas chosen by students.
c. Greater breadth will be enabled by the essential courses that all students will take, while 
greater depth will be enabled through courses based on student choice. 
d.  Students will receive greater attention to their personal and career aspirations as they ready 
themselves for work or higher education.  
e. The Secondary Stage will be divided into two phases:
i. 
 Broad Curricular Areas (e.g., Science, Social Science, Humanities) will be offered in 
Grade 9 and 10 to enable breadth. Learning Standards are defined for this phase, and it 
is expected that all students attain these learning standards.
ii. 
Disciplines (e.g., History, Physics, Language) within each Curricular Area will be offered 
in Grade 11 and 12 to enable depth. The students have a choice in selecting specific 
areas and disciplines. They make these choices based on their interests and their future 
plans either in the world of work or in higher education after their school completion. 
There are no common learning standards for this phase, while each of the disciplines 
would have its specific competencies and learning outcomes defined. 
2.4.4.1 
Design of Grades 9 and 10
To complete Grade 10, students will complete two Essential Courses from each of the eight Cur-
ricular Areas available i.e., a total of 16 Essential Courses across two years of Grade 9 and 10. 
These either Curricular Areas – Humanities (that includes languages), Mathematics & Comput-
ing, Vocational Education, Physical Education, Arts, Social Science, Science, and Inter-disciplinary 
Areas gives the necessary breadth of understanding and capacities for the students.
54
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part A
Grades 9 and 10 will follow an annual structure (a semester structure in these classes is possible 
to construct but is unnecessary since all students will do all the essential courses). 
Students must clear 8 Board examinations at end of Grade 10 - these assess each of the two Es-
sential Courses in each Curricular Area learnt during Grades 9 and 10. 
Figure A-2.4-i
 
The final certification will be based on the cumulative result of each of the examinations. 
2.4.4.2 
Design of Grades 11 and 12
The same set of eight Curricular Areas will continue to be on offer, but choice-based courses will 
be designed based on the Disciplines within the Curricular Areas to ensure deeper and more 
rigorous engagement. Choice-based courses and their content will be designed on the basis of 
the specific nature of disciplines. 
This phase of the Secondary Stage would be divided into semesters and each choice-based course 
would be for a semester. Students must complete 16 choice-based courses to complete 
Grade 12. 
To ensure that the students have adequate breadth, they have to choose Disciplines from at least 
three Curricular Areas. To ensure depth, when they choose a Discipline, they have to complete 
four choice-based courses in that Discipline.

In the case of academic disciplines, the intent of these four courses should be to give an introduc-
tion to give a good introduction to the discipline. By gaining knowledge of the key conceptual 
structures and theories of the discipline, and developing capacities of inquiry in that discipline, 
students can make informed decisions about the pursuit of this discipline in higher education.  
In the case of vocational areas, these four courses should equip that student to enter the world 
of work in that particular vocation. 
Table A-2.4-i
As an illustration, if a student chooses Social Science (Curricular Area) and History (Discipline) 
within that, she must complete all four courses in History. She could then choose the Humanities 
as the second Curricular Area and do four courses in Philosophy. Mathematics could be the third 
Curricular Area with four courses in Computer Science. The fourth set of courses could be from 
one of the three Curricular Areas already chosen or from a completely different one.
Alternatively, if a student chooses Science (Curricular Area) and Physics (Discipline) within that, 
she must complete all four courses in Physics. She could then choose Arts as the second Curricu-
lar Area and do four courses in Music. Mathematics could be the third Curricular Area with four 
courses in Mathematics. The fourth set of courses could be from one of the three Curricular Ar-
eas already chosen or from a completely different one.
Modular Board Examinations will be offered as opposed to a single examination at the end of the 
year. The final certification will be based on the cumulative result of each of the examinations.

a. Design Considerations of Disciplinary Courses
The following are some of the key considerations for designing the Disciplinary Courses:
1. Each discipline has four courses through which a thorough introduction to the discipline 
is given to the students. Each course is semester-long in duration.
2. Since students have a wide choice Disciplines should not assume that students would 
choose the complementing Disciplines. For e.g., the Biology courses cannot assume that 
students are enrolled in Chemistry in their Grade 11 and 12. 
3. The intention should be not to “cover” all the important concepts in that discipline. This 
would result in a very high content load. Instead, the design should focus on some key 
conceptual structures and theories in that discipline, along with an adequate emphasis 
on the methods of inquiry in that discipline. 
4. The students should develop an understanding of how this discipline fits within the 
Curricular Area and what are currently the open questions that the discipline is engaging 
with. 
2.4.4.3 
Implications for Secondary Schools
All Secondary Schools will need to offer Essential Courses in all the Curricular Areas so that all 
students are able to complete Grade 10. The design and learning standards for the Essential 
Courses have been articulated in the NCF.
Since the Grade 11 and 12 of the Secondary Stage has a wide range of Disciplines, many schools 
might struggle to offer this entire range. This in effect limits the choice for the students. To en-
sure that students have a reasonable choice, Secondary Schools, to begin with, must offer at 
least one Curricular Area from each of the following categories: 
a. Category 1: Humanities or Social Science or Science or Mathematics and Computing
b. Category 2: Inter-disciplinary Areas
c. Category 3: Arts or Sports or Vocational Education
In the medium term, more and more schools must offer as many of the Curricular Areas as pos-
sible to truly enable student choice

Standards, Content, Pedagogy,  
 
Assessment across Stages
Chapter 1 has articulated the Aims of School Education. These aims have been derived from the 
vision and purposes of education outlined in NEP 2020. Chapter 2 detailed the four-stage design 
of schooling as recommended by NEP 2020. This Chapter draws out the approaches taken by the 
NCF towards defining Learning Standards, selection of Content, methods of teaching and assess-
ments. It gives an outline of how the Aims of School Education are to be achieved.

 Approach to Learning Standards
Education can be seen both as a process and an outcome. When we view education as an achieve-
ment we think about a student’s achievement of the desirable knowledge, capacities, values and 
dispositions as derived from the Aims of School Education. To bring clarity to all stakeholders on 
what is it that is to be achieved by schools, this NCF has articulated the educational achievements 
as clear Learning Standards. Clarity on what is intended to be achieved is beneficial to teachers, 
students, educational functionaries, parents, and society as a whole. Clarity of purpose is one 
important step towards success and this NCF hopes that the Learning Standards provide that 
clarity of purpose. This section first defines a few terms used in this NCF in the context of Learn-
ing Standards and then gives an approach to arriving at the Learning Standards.
3.1.1 Definitions
a. Aims of School Education: Aims are educational vision statements that give broad direc-
tion to all deliberate efforts of educational systems – curriculum development, institutional 
arrangements, funding and financing, people’s capacities and so on. Aims of School Educa-
tion are usually directed by education policy documents. For example, NEP 2020 states that 
“The purpose of the education system is to develop good human beings capable of rational 
thought and action, possessing compassion and empathy, courage and resilience, scientific 
temper, and creative imagination, with sound ethical moorings and values. It aims at produc-
ing engaged, productive, and contributing citizens for building an equitable, inclusive, and 
plural society as envisaged by our Constitution.” The NCF has derived the Aims of Education 
from NEP 2020, and the aims have been articulated in Chapter 2.
b. Curricular Goals: Curricular Goals are statements that give directions to curriculum 
development and implementation. They are derived from Aims and are specific to a Stage in 
education (e.g., the Foundational Stage). National Curriculum Frameworks which guide the 
development of all curricula state the Curricular Goals. For example, in this NCF “Children 
develop effective communication skills for day-to-day interactions in two languages” is a 
Curricular Goal for the Foundational Stage. 
c. Competencies: Competencies are learning achievements that are observable and can be 
assessed systematically. These Competencies are derived from the Curricular Goals and are 
expected to be attained by the end of a Stage. Competencies are articulated in Curriculum 
Frameworks. However, curriculum developers can adapt and modify the competencies to 
address specific contexts for which the curriculum is being developed. The following are 
examples of some of the Competencies derived for the above Curricular Goal in this NCF - 
“Converses fluently and can hold a meaningful conversation” and “Understands oral instruc-
tions for a complex task and gives clear oral instructions for the same to others.”
d. Learning Outcomes: Competencies are attained over a period of time. Therefore, interim 
markers of learning achievements are needed so that Teachers can observe and track 
learning and respond to the needs of learners continually. These interim markers are 
Learning Outcomes. Thus, Learning Outcomes are granular milestones of learning and 
usually progress in a sequence leading to attainment of a Competency. Learning Outcomes 
60

enable Teachers to plan their content, pedagogy, and assessment towards achieving specific 
Competencies. Curriculum developers and Teachers should have the autonomy to define 
Learning Outcomes as appropriate to their classroom contexts, while maintaining the 
connection to the Competencies. 
e. The following table is an example of Learning Outcomes derived for the Competency 
“Converses fluently and can hold a meaningful conversation” in the Foundational Stage:

3.1.2 From Aims to Learning Outcomes
This NCF strongly emphasises the importance of the clear flow-down that must be there from 
Aims of School Education to Curricular Goals to Competencies to Learning Outcomes. Each set 
must emanate from the immediately higher level, while ensuring full coverage of the objectives 
at the immediately higher level. 
This is a process of ‘breaking down and converting’ relatively abstract and consolidated notions 
to more concrete components, in order to make them useable in the practice of education. This 
process, including other considerations that must be accounted for in this ‘flow-down,’ are de-
scribed in this Chapter.  It is only such coherence, coverage, and connection arising from a rigor-
ous ‘flow-down,’ from Aims of Education to Learning Outcomes, that can align syllabus, content, 
pedagogical practices, institutional culture, and more to achieving what we want from education. 
61
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part A
This is simply because in the everyday life of the Teacher and institutions, efforts are  (or can be) 
made towards achieving very specific, observable, and short-period learning objectives which 
are marked as Learning Outcomes; and which when arising from the process of ‘flow-down’ de-
scribed, guide the trajectory of educational efforts towards the attainment of Competencies, 
which in turn accumulate to Curricular Goals, and which taken together would fulfil the relevant 
Aims of Education.  
NEP 2020 has articulated the vision and purpose of education. This NCF has drawn the Aims of 
School Education from this vision. The Curricular Goals are in turn derived from these Aims, with 
other relevant considerations. The Competencies then have been drawn from these Curricular 
Goals and the Learning Outcomes from those Competencies. 
It must be noted that the Competencies and the Learning Outcomes are illustrative. 
Curriculum developers should carefully consider the set of Competencies in the NCF and use 
these, after making relevant changes where and if required. Given the relative stability and 
cross-cutting relevance of Competencies across contexts (and time), there may be fewer require-
ments for changes in the Competencies articulated in the NCF; however, decisions on this matter 
should be carefully considered by curriculum developers. 
The Learning Outcomes are far more contextual and will, therefore, require close attention and 
contextualisation, for the curriculum or syllabus being developed. The developers may use the 
sets articulated in the NCF, but this must be done after due consideration, and there must be no 
hesitation to use more relevant sets. 
Thus, the States and their relevant institutions, and other institutions responsible for cur-
riculum and syllabus development, would need to conduct a rigorous exercise of such a 
flow-down, to arrive at the full set of Learning Standards for their use.
3.1.3 From Aims to Curricular Goals
The Aims of School Education, as envisaged in Chapter 2 of this NCF, give direction to the intend-
ed educational achievements for the four school stages. Curricular Goals are stage specific as 
mentioned before.
In this NCF, Curricular Goals for the Foundation Stage are defined for the different domains of 
development. It is appropriate that at the Foundational Stage the curriculum is closely aligned 
with the domains of child development. From the Preparatory Stage onwards, the Curricular 
Goals are defined for specific Curricular Areas. These Curricular Areas have been defined in 
Chapter 2 along with the aims.  
The aims are only one source for arriving at stage-specific Curricular Goals. These are some of 
the considerations that inform the articulation of Curricular Goals:
a. Aims of School Education, as articulated by the NCF
b. Nature of Knowledge that is relevant to the Curricular Area
c. Age appropriateness specific to the stage of schooling
62
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part A
The Aims of School Education as articulated in Chapter 2 are an important source for deriving 
the Curricular Goals. The Curricular Goals are to be arrived at from the desirable knowledge, 
capacities, and values and dispositions that are relevant to the Curricular Area which would con-
tribute to achieving the aims. 
3.1.4 From Curricular Goals to Competencies
The four main sources for arriving at the list of Competencies are:
a. Curricular Goals
b. Current research literature appropriate for the Stage and Curricular Area that informs  
c. Experience of various educational efforts in the country
d. Our context, which includes resource availability, time availability, institutional, and Teacher 
capacities
Each stage has its own considerations regarding children’s development and concept develop-
ment (elaborated in Chapter 3) which have an impact on the choice of the Competencies within 
each Curricular Goal.
All stakeholders in school education should have clear visibility of the Competencies that are 
expected to be achieved. Keeping track of progress in the attainment of these Competencies for 
every child would allow school systems to ensure that all children receive appropriate learning 
opportunities towards reaching the Curricular Goals of the NCF.
3.1.5 From Competencies to Learning Outcomes
Learning Outcomes are interim markers of learning achievement towards the attainment of 
Competencies. They are defined based on the specifics of the socio-cultural contexts, the materi-
als and resources available, and contingencies of the classroom. A set of illustrative Learning 
Outcomes have been defined in this NCF, based on the broad understanding of the context our 
education system. 
These Learning Outcomes need to be seen as enabling guidelines for Teachers and school 
leaders and not as constraining demands on them. They have the autonomy to reimagine 
the Learning Outcomes based on their contexts.
 
63
National Curriculum Framework for School Education

Section 3.2 
 Approach to Content
“Curriculum content will be reduced in each subject to its core essentials, to make space for critical 
thinking and more holistic, inquiry-based, discovery-based, discussion-based, and analysis-based 
learning. The mandated content will focus on key concepts, ideas, applications, and problem solv-
ing.” [NEP 2020, 4.5] 
“The reduction in, and increased flexibility of, school curriculum content – and the renewed empha-
sis on constructivist rather than rote learning – must be accompanied by parallel changes in school 
textbooks. All textbooks shall aim to contain the essential core material (together with discussion, 
analysis, examples, and applications) deemed important on a national level, but at the same time 
contain any desired nuances and supplementary material in accordance with local contexts and 
needs.” [NEP 2020, 4.31]
Content to be used in the teaching-learning process includes the learning environment, teaching 
learning materials and books. Developing books, including textbooks, must follow a rigorous 
process based on an appropriate syllabus. The arrangement and organization of the learning 
environment is important across all Stages but most especially for the Foundational and Prepa-
ratory Stages. Carefully selected Teaching Learning Materials play an essential role in all class-
rooms.
3.2.1 Core Essentials of the Curriculum
The Learning Standards (Curricular Goals, Competencies and Learning Outcomes) are the basis 
for what will be taught and learnt through school. As students progress through the Stages, they 
will move from learning perceptual concepts to practical concepts to theoretical concepts using 
play and exploration to methods of more rigorous inquiry. 
As per the NEP 2020, all students must study the core essentials of each curricular area to make 
space and time to focus on developing capacities and values that are part of the aims of school 
education. Each curricular area will choose the core essentials based on the nature of knowledge 
of that area, the capacities it seeks to develop and the demands of each particular Stage of school-
ing.
3.2.2 Learning Environment, Learning Material
A safe, inclusive, and stimulating environment that supports every student’s participation is crit-
ical for achieving the Learning Standards outlined in the NCF. 
Classrooms that are clean, well-ventilated, and well-lit, adequate resources and material avail-
able and organized with appropriate access and safety provisions are important to facilitate 
learning. Classrooms should allow for both individual work and cooperative work. Classroom 
displays should be available for student work. Students with developmental delay or disability 
may need specific accommodations for both physical space and teaching learning materials to 
enable physical and curricular access. 
64
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part A
For the Foundational and Preparatory Stages, classrooms may be organized into Learning Cor-
ners for specific domains of learning. Availability of a range of safe and stimulating material that 
encourages learning in different domains of development, literacy and numeracy would be nec-
essary for all students. 
Well-resourced libraries and laboratories would be necessary for the Middle and Secondary 
Stages.  Art education, physical education and vocational education would require specific kinds 
of spaces and material available and organized in particular ways. 
3.2.3 Broad Approach to Content Selection 
Curricular Goals, Competencies and Learning Outcomes give clear direction as to what content is 
to be used for creating learning experiences for students
Concepts formed in the Foundational and Preparatory Stages are largely perceptive (e.g., colour 
as visually discriminated) and practical (e.g., spoon used as a lever to open a tin cover, money to 
buy things in a shop) but not theoretical (e.g., colour as a spectrum of light, lever as a simple 
machine, or money as a medium of exchange). Exploring the theories behind the perceptive and 
practical concepts is expected in the Middle and Secondary Stages of schooling. Choices of con-
tent for each Stage must be based on this. 
Content in the Foundational and Preparatory Stages should be derived from children’s life expe-
riences and reflect the cultural, geographical, and social context in which the child is developing 
and growing. As students move through the Middle and Secondary Stages, content should move 
away from the familiar and include ideas and theories not necessarily represented in the imme-
diate environment.
Content should be tied to capacities and values that students need to develop through Stages of 
schooling. Special care should be taken to avoid promotion of stereotypes.
3.2.4 Broad Principles of Textbook Design
a. Curriculum Principle: The textbook should be designed specifically to achieve the Compe-
tencies for the Stage and the Learning Outcomes for the Grade. Textbook developers and 
designers should not only be aware of the Competencies of the particular domain or curric-
ular area for which the textbook is being developed, but also the Competencies for the 
whole Stage. This would allow them to bring in horizontal connections across the domains 
and curricular areas across the Stage.
b. Discipline Principle: Textbook developers should have sound knowledge of the discipline 
associated with the textbook being developed. The content and sequence included in the 
textbook should be careful not to contradict some of the core principles of these disciplines.
c. Pedagogy Principle: Textbook developers need to have a clear understanding of the 
pedagogy that is appropriate for the Competency and content (e.g., in language the bal-
anced approach of including oral language, phonics and word solving instruction and 
meaning making needs to be incorporated all together for the Foundational Stage). 
65
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part A
d. Technology Principle: Textbook developers should be aware of the current technology and 
audio-visual materials available for enhancing learning experiences of students. Activities 
that involve digital technology and references to external material should be embedded 
appropriately in the textbook.
e. Context Principle: The local context and environment is important in the Foundational and 
Preparatory Stages.  important consideration for choice of content in the textbook. Moving 
from the familiar to unfamiliar is an important aspect of learning and the textbook should 
contain a balance of both familiar contexts that is a comfort for the children and unfamiliar 
contexts that should generate curiosity and challenge to their thoughts and preferences. For 
the Middle and Secondary Stages, this may not be a strong consideration in all curricular 
areas.
f. Presentation Principle: The textbooks should grab the attention of students. For the 
Foundational and Preparatory Stages, the balance between visual material and text should 
be tilted towards visual materials. The colour schemes and design themes should be attrac-
tive and consistent. The fonts and size of text material should be both visible and least 
confusing for young children to decode. For the Middle and Secondary Stages, the flow of 
concepts, clarity in articulation and well-designed illustration to show the same would be 
important.
g. Diversity and Inclusion: In the Indian context, it is important to maintain diversity and 
inclusion as an important principle in the choice of content for textbooks. Even within 
States there are regional variations and these need to find adequate representation in 
textbooks. Balanced gender and community representation must be ensured.
3.2.5 Process for Textbook Development
Applying the principles of textbook development, the process could be the following:
a. Creation of a syllabus document – Drawing from the Curricular Goals, Competencies and 
Learning Outcomes; nature, pedagogy, and assessment of a subject; the syllabus document 
could include the objectives of teaching the subject, approach to the content to be included 
(concept or theme), structure of the syllabus document (as questions, key concepts, sug-
gested strategies or activities), choosing content that is cognitively and socio-culturally rele-
vant. The syllabus document could also use literature from research studies, policy papers, 
Teacher experiences, subject matter expert opinions for deciding the extent and depth of 
the content.
b. Panel of textbook writers, reviewers, and designers/illustrators - The people involved 
in textbook development could be: 
i. 
Textbook writers and reviewers – Teachers must be part of this group – others could 
include subject experts, university faculty and research scholars.
ii. Designers/Illustrators – People/organisations that have both design understanding 
and understanding of the local context, preferably local experts and should be involved 
from the start of the process.
66
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part A
iii. Technical Expert – A lot of content that complements the textbook can be made 
available through digital media. It is important for the technical expert to be part of the 
textbook development team from the start - media content should not be an 
afterthought.
The group should work together from the beginning to create a common understanding of 
the process and be open to feedback, suggestions, and multiple iterations of the textbook.
c. Choice of content, pedagogy, and assessment – The topics/themes chosen would need to 
include the context of the student (including previous experiences, language) and scope for 
further exploration. The content at each Grade should be a precursor to the next. It is 
essential to ensure an alignment of the pedagogy and assessment with the content and the 
Learning Outcomes.
d. Structure of the textbook – Considering that the textbook is an important point of connect 
between the Teacher and the student, it would need to be useful for both.  Content in 
textbooks are largely directed towards students. It has been a practice to include notes for 
teachers in the textbook. This approach is limiting and this NCF recommends that each 
textbook released for students should be accompanied by a Teacher’s version of the same 
textbook. (Please see the box below)
e. Presentation and Design – The presentation of a textbook relies on the font size, images, 
sketches, the colours used, and on the amalgamation of the three e.g., textual content in the 
early Grades may be limited with a large number of images, font size should be large, and 
the illustrations used should be sensitive and inclusive. The language used would need to 
be Grade-appropriate and relevant to the subject.
f. Writing, review, and pilot run – The writing of a textbook needs sufficient time, regular 
peer reviews and panel reviews. Regular sittings with the illustrators to define and reiterate 
the requirement of the content being worked on is necessary. This adds to the rigour of 
textbook creation and assists in avoiding repetitions in text, images, ideas across subjects as 
the illustrators work with all the writers.  
The review provided would need to be constructive and encouraging. The feedback should 
include suggestions and alternative ideas. The writers should be open to multiple iterations 
and be cognizant of the principles of writing content. The review process must be done 
chapter wise and then for the textbook as a whole. Meticulous proof reading of the textbook 
is essential and contributes to their quality. 
Selected schools must be identified for the pilot run of the textbooks. During the pilot run of 
the textbooks, the writers must visit schools and schedule classroom observations, conver-
sations with Teachers, children, parents, and receive feedback about the textbook.
g. Teacher orientation to the textbooks - There must be provision for Teacher orientation 
on the genesis of the textbook, its rationale, the approach to pedagogy and assessment to 
ensure its appropriate use in the classroom. This orientation must be followed up through 
school visits, webinars, sharing of best practices and regular interactions with the Teachers 
to understand the challenges being faced in the use of the textbooks.
67
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part A
Box A-3.2-i 
Teacher’s Handbook
It has been a practice to include notes to Teachers in the textbook. This approach is 
limiting and not desirable. If notes are kept to their briefest minimum, it is not really 
useful for the Teacher. If they are elaborate and detailed, it unnecessarily increases the 
size of the textbook for the students and it perhaps would also be intimidating. 
It is recommended that each textbook that is being published should be accompanied by 
a Teacher’s version (textbook+) of the same textbook. The textbook+ should be organized 
in the same sequence of chapters as the students’ textbook but can additional materials:
• Intended learning objectives of the chapter and how it is connected to the Learning 
Standards of the curriculum.
• Recommended pedagogical strategies relevant for that chapter. 
• Alternative activities for students who are struggling to grasp the content.
• References (through QR-Codes) for digital materials, additional worksheets, formative 
assessments, pedagogical content knowledge packages etc. that provide both 
additional teaching aides and also develops a more profound understanding in the 
teacher of the topic under consideration. 
Thus, the textbook+ would be valuable compendium for the teacher to go well beyond the 
textbook’s content, without burdening or intimidating the students.
3.2.6 Teacher Support for Meaningful Use of Textbooks 
A textbook must contain guidelines for the Teacher to indicate the broad approach to teach-
ing-learning, as well as how to use the textbook optimally. It must indicate the Competencies 
students are to attain as a result of transacting a set of materials/activities suggested in the text-
book, as well as expected Learning Outcomes for each chapter or unit or lesson.
The textbook must also provide the Teacher guidelines on processes like learning tasks, activi-
ties, projects, field trips, simple experiments as well as assessment. It must contain tables, fig-
ures, flow charts, cartoons, pictures that enable attainment of Learning Outcomes while also 
providing inputs to the Teacher on similar materials that can be sourced locally.
Notes to the Teacher explaining the rationale for content or activity as well as suggestions, and 
dedicated Teacher pages containing notes at strategic points in the textbook, as well pages pro-
viding practical suggestions which can extend to both the Teacher’s classroom transaction in 
addition to the scope of the textbook are some devices that can be used within the textbook.
If practicable, a Teacher manual can be developed as a companion to the textbook, aligned to 
both its approach and content. While the Teacher manual is primarily intended for the Teacher, 
its use will benefit children as well. For example, the Teacher manual can include suggestions on 
accommodating diversity in the classroom, contextualizing content that may have been selected 
at the State level and linkages with other subjects. It can explain the developmental needs of 
children and how learning happens in the specific subject that will help the Teacher align peda-
gogy and assessment accordingly.
68
National Curriculum Framework for School Education

Section 3.3 
Pedagogy
A good educational institution is one in which every student feels welcomed and cared for, where a 
safe and stimulating learning environment exists, where a wide range of learning experiences are 
offered, and where good physical infrastructure and appropriate resources conducive to learning 
are available to all students [NEP 2020, Principles]
Pedagogy is the method and practice of teaching used in classrooms by the Teacher to help stu-
dents learn. Effective pedagogy is based on a good understanding of how children grow and 
learn and has clear focus on curricular goals, curricular competencies and learning outcomes to 
be achieved for students across Stages of School Education. 
3.3.1 How do Children Grow and Learn?
Healthy physical development requires basic needs of adequate nutrition, and appropriate sen-
sory and emotional stimulation. There are ‘critical periods’ in sensory development, e.g., normal 
visual experience is critical within the first few months of life. There are ‘sensitive periods’ in 
cognitive and emotional development e.g., early childhood and adolescence. Physiological chang-
es have ramifications on the psychological and social aspects of a child’s life.
From an evolutionary point of view, human beings are born to learn, so we come with a drive to 
understand the world, to explain what is around us. We constantly make our own theories and 
refine them based on our perceptions and experience.
Children are, therefore, natural learners. They are active, eager to learn, and respond with inter-
est in new things. They have an innate sense of curiosity - they wonder, question, explore, try out, 
and discover to make sense of the world.  By acting on their curiosity, they continue to discover 
and learn more. 
Research from across the world has provided us with a set of ideas about how children learn that 
have practical implications for teaching, most importantly:  
a. The brain plays an important role in learning: The brain is a complex organ made up of 
neurons, glial cells, blood vessels and many, many cells organized into specialized areas. 
The working of the brain is the ever-changing patterns of connections between millions of 
neurons. Learning is a physical process in which new knowledge is represented by new 
brain cell connections. The brain both shapes and is shaped by experience, including 
opportunities the child has for cognitive development and social interaction. The brain is 
designed to learn and remember new things through life, as long as it continues to be 
challenged and stimulated. 
b. Learning is based on the associations and connections children make: Children are 
far from blank slates on which we can simply write pages and pages of information. They 
have knowledge and understandings based on their experience; they have intuitive theories 
about varied subjects. Nothing is ever recorded in a child’s brain exactly as it is experienced. 
69
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part A
It is their interpretation of what they experience that becomes new knowledge. Interpreta-
tion is always in the light of whatever knowledge they already possess. Children are contin-
uously fitting new experiences into existing knowledge and adjusting existing knowledge to 
allow new experiences. 
c. Emotions are deeply connected to learning: Emotions are inextricably intertwined with 
attention, motivation and cognition. Positive emotions like curiosity, wonder, joy and 
excitement aid attention, cognition and memory and, therefore, learning. Positive emotions 
are often best nurtured through positive relationships with Teachers and among students. 
When students feel they belong in a classroom and they can trust, they feel free to try out 
and explore and, therefore, learn better. As trust grows, the classroom becomes emotional-
ly safer, and students have fewer obstacles to build their confidence and their learning. 
d. The learning environment matters: The word environment refers to both the physical 
space and the ‘atmosphere’ or psychological environment in the classroom. The physical 
environment provides a structure that allows safe exploration, cognitive growth and chal-
lenge. The atmosphere or psychological environment is made up of all the relationships and 
social interactions that happen in the classroom. A safe, secure, comfortable, and happy 
classroom environment can help children to learn better and achieve more. For this, it is im-
portant that the necessary facilities such as learning materials, aids, equipment, and space 
for doing activities, working together, and playing so as to help each child learn better are 
made available. The classroom must be an inclusive, enabling learning environment that 
provides every child freedom, openness, acceptance, meaningfulness, belonging and chal-
lenge.
e. Learning occurs in particular social and cultural environments: Learning in school 
becomes meaningful when it connects to students’ lives and experiences. Most children 
grow up with stories, songs, games, food, rituals, and festivals special to their families and 
community along with local ways of dressing or working or travelling or living that are an 
integral part of their everyday lives. The diverse experiences of children must find a place in 
the classroom. As children grow up, while there may often be a difference between the 
culture of a student’s home and the culture of the classroom, it is important to continue to 
listen to student’s voices and honour their cultural traditions in the classroom.
3.3.2 Effective Pedagogy for Achieving Aims of School  
  
Education
As stated in Chapter 1, Section 1.3, the central purpose of schools as formal educational institu-
tions is the achievement of valuable knowledge, capacities, and values/dispositions by students. 
Based on how children learn, some key elements of pedagogy for achieving these aims are below. 
a. Knowledge (knowing that – concepts, theories, principles) 
Children form concepts and intuitive theories right from infancy. To learn a new theory or 
concept or principle, children fit this new experience into their existing knowledge and 
adjust their existing knowledge to allow new experiences in.   
To help children do this well, teachers need to structure and sequence the teaching of 
concepts appropriately, connect new concepts to students’ existing experience and under-
standing, pose questions that challenge their existing understanding and make clear 
demonstrations that push their thinking beyond their existing understanding. All this, while

ensuring their full participation in open discussions and hands-on activities. Teaching 
concepts, theories or principles in disconnected chunks or expecting students to reproduce 
them in the same way they were received makes true conceptual understanding impossible. 
Box A-3.3-i 
Importance of memory
The ancient Indian emphasis on Smriti (memory) is critical to learning and development. 
It has often been misunderstood as an emphasis on rote learning, which in principle and 
when practised with fidelity, it was not. 
Current cognitive science research indicates that Smriti (memory) - both working memory 
and long-term memory - plays an important role in cognition and comprehension. Insuffi-
cient emphasis on memory often results in inadequate outcomes in the classroom. When we 
use memory inappropriately, we are ignoring its powers and capacities.
Using memory for learning in the classroom encompasses a variety of activities - deliberate 
and regular practice, deep processing, generating cues, making connections, and forming 
associations.
b. Capacities (knowing how - abilities and skills)   
Abilities and skills are learnt best by doing and they improve with repeated exposure and 
practice. Good practice involves meaningful variety, must be done in appropriate quantity 
and is supplemented with continuous discussions on why certain procedures work and 
others do not.
Box A-3.3-ii 
Importance of Practice
Learning is a time-consuming process. Organized, regular and steady practice yields steady 
and positive impact on learning. Practicing helps to internalize information; access more 
complex information stored in long-term memory and apply knowledge or skills automati-
cally. 
Across curricular areas, differences in students’ performance are affected by how much they 
engage in deliberate practice. Deliberate practice is not the same as rote repetition. Rote 
repetition does not improve performance by itself. Deliberate practice involves attention, 
rehearsal and repetition and leads to new knowledge or skills that can later be developed 
into more complex knowledge and skills. 
When a skill becomes automatic, attention and mental resources can be freed up for higher 
level thinking and reasoning.
Most Teachers are aware of two contradictory facts - drill can be boring, and yet practice is the 
only way for their students to master certain procedures. The problem with drill comes when we 
assume that it will substitute for understanding. Concepts and procedures are two different 
things, both of which students need to learn. Practice alone cannot lead to conceptual knowledge 
and understanding alone cannot lead to mastery of a procedure.

c. Values and Dispositions
‘Telling’ children about what values they should develop or uphold usually has very little 
effect. It either becomes ‘boring’ or seems like ‘preaching.’  
Development of values and dispositions in school education happens primarily in the 
following ways: 
i. 
Through School and Classroom culture e.g., sensitivity and respect for others is 
encouraged when opportunities are provided for all students to participate in activities 
and select students do not end up participating in all activities.
ii. Through School and Classroom practices e.g., stories about particular values or regular 
bal sabhas and bal panchayats help to build notions of democracy, justice and equality.
iii. As part of learning through school subjects e.g., laboratory experiments and trials help 
build scientific thinking. 
iv. As direct goals of some school subjects e.g., learning to win and lose with grace during 
sports and games helps build resilience.  
Box A-3.3-iii 
Importance of Questioning
We have a long and ancient tradition of questioning in India. Debate and discussion have 
always been held as a critical part of the Indian knowledge tradition. 
The Upanishads were written in response to the questions of shishyas. The literal meaning of 
the word Upanishad is the sitting down (of the shishya) near (the guru). The usual method 
of argument utilized reason and went from simple to complex, from concrete to abstract, 
from known to unknown. 
In the Katha Upanishad, is the powerful story of Nachiketa, a young boy, who dared to ask 
Yama, the lord of death, a very simple but fundamental question: ‘Is there life after death, or 
is death the end?’ 
At different periods in time, India has produced exceptional scholars who were uncondition-
al masters in their respective schools of thought. It was often the custom among learned 
men to debate the merits and demerits of these various systems of philosophy. The debates 
between Adi Shankara and Mandana Misra, for example, are legendary. Thousands of 
scholars gathered every day to watch and learn from them. 
This debate between two luminaries throws light on the healthy competition that existed 
among followers of different philosophies. They had open minds and the immense courage 
to test their faith, to question their beliefs, and to change their philosophies, if reason 
demanded the change. Through this process, it was always important to remain accepting 
towards new concepts, experiments, or questionings.
Some values are developed better through particular processes, illustratively,
i. 
Regular dialogue and discussion with active listening as part of classroom culture and 
processes will help develop democratic values (e.g., pluralism, equality, justice, fraternity).
ii. 
Curricular areas like Arts and Physical Education will help build individual virtues (e.g., 
honesty, courage). 
72
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part A
iii. Curricular areas like Science and Mathematics will help build epistemic values (e.g., 
scientific temper, mathematical reasoning).
iv. 
Marking important days through community service as part of school culture and practices 
will help build cultural values (e.g., seva, ahimsa, shanti).
v. 
Regular practices at the school assembly will help promote pride in India’s cultural 
diversity.
3.3.3 Key Elements that Enable Effective Pedagogy in the  
  
Classroom
a. Ensuring respect and care 
Our schools are committed to providing an environment where children feel secure, and 
relationships are governed by care, equity, and respect. Any form of discrimination based 
on religion, caste, gender, community, beliefs, disability, or any other factor, is unacceptable. 
Teachers must value and respect all students. Classrooms should be spaces that will offer all 
students equal access and equal opportunity to achieve learning outcomes. All children will 
participate in a variety of activities and school processes not just those with the best 
chances of success. Our schools will create an environment that enhances the potential and 
interests of each child.  
Care is central to learning in schools. Care is an attitude of concern and responsibility for 
people and relationships. Empathy and respect are at the heart of caring.
b. Building positive Teacher-student relationships 
A safe, positive relationship between Teacher and student is enriching both for cognitive 
and socio-emotional development.  
Some important ways to build such a positive relationship are:
i. 
Getting to know each student individually - this helps to understand and plan 
learning experiences for each of them.
ii. Listening carefully to students - this conveys care and respect, builds trust, helps 
students gain confidence.
iii. Observing students - this helps to discover how each student thinks, reasons and 
responds to different situations, which is critical to planning for teaching and learning.
iv. Encouraging student responses - this helps to meaningfully build on children’s 
naturally creative and resourceful selves.
v. Encouraging questioning - questions to and from the Teacher helps students think 
through a particular subject in depth while responding. 
vi. Recognizing and responding to the emotions and moods of students - this helps 
them to settle and learn better, learn to regulate their own emotions, and to understand 
and respond to the emotions of others.
73

Box A-3.3-iv 
Ways of the Guru
According to Shri Aurobindo, the three instruments of the Guru are teaching, example and 
influence.
Wise teachers do not seek to impose themselves or their opinions on the passive acceptance 
of receptive minds. They seek to awaken much more than to instruct, they aim at the growth 
of faculties and experience by a natural process and free expansion. They prescribe a meth-
od as an aid, as a utilizable device, not as imperative formula, or a fixed routine. 
As the Taittiriya Upanishad tells us, the Teacher is the first letter, the student is the last 
letter, knowledge is the meeting place and instruction is the link.
c. Providing scaffolding
Students can easily learn new knowledge when systematic support from other experienced 
students or adults is provided. Learning new knowledge should be a challenge, but the 
challenge should be within the reach of students - something that relates to their existing 
knowledge and can be done with the support of an experienced person.  
Scaffolding refers to providing support, structure, and guidance during instruction. Scaf-
folding differs, depending on the task, but occurs when the Teacher carefully students a 
learning task and provides support along the way until gradually fading as the student 
reaches expertise.  
One way of scaffolding is through a ‘Gradual Release of Responsibility’ (GRR) where first, 
Teachers model or explain ideas or skills; after which students and Teachers work together 
on the same ideas and skills where the Teacher provides guided support; and finally, stu-
dents practice individually and independently.
d. Using differentiated instruction
Teachers will need to plan classes in a way that engages students with varying interests and 
capabilities meaningfully and encourages better learning. 
One way to think about this is differentiated instruction i.e., tailoring the teaching process 
according to the individual needs of students. Content, methods of learning, material, and 
assessment may be different for different children. It is often difficult to do this for individu-
al children, especially in a large class. In that case, the Teacher could identify small groups 
of children who have similar needs and address them differently as a group.  
Before planning for this, it is important for the Teacher to observe students carefully, 
analyse their work and gather as much information as possible about them. e.g., The Teach-
er could plan to use worksheets of varying levels, starting with simple worksheets and 
progress to more complex ones according to what different groups of students in the class 
are able to do.
e. Providing opportunities for independent and collaborative work
Classroom processes should provide opportunities for students to work individually and to 
work together. Teachers may ensure that children work in pairs, small and large groups as 
well as independently. Teachers must help students to listen, understand, appreciate, and 
reflect on their own thought process and other’s experiences with empathy and critical 
understanding.   
74
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part A
Working with others often increases involvement in learning. Sharing one’s own ideas and 
responding to others’ reactions improves thinking and deepens understanding. In carefully 
crafted collaborative learning situations, students require the contribution of each other to 
successfully complete a learning task because of which they need to learn to take on varied 
roles e.g., as observers, mediators, score manager, note-takers based on the objectives of the 
task.
f. Using varied resources
Using the textbook meaningfully is important for learning. In addition, other resources and 
materials must be used to engage students beyond the textbook. Classroom processes 
should incorporate use of resources made by students, teachers, and the local community 
as well as those available in the immediate environment. Digital resources must also be 
incorporated appropriately. 
Classroom displays constitute an important part of the learning process which should not 
be limited to finished products alone - they could also include aspects of work in progress. 
g. Helping students develop appropriate work habits and responsibility   
Developing appropriate work habits and taking responsibility are critical to learning. These 
include aspects like students’ organizing space and materials before and after use, organiz-
ing time, ensuring time on task, taking responsibility for tasks, persisting with, and com-
pleting work, staying on a given task even without a Teacher present, and allowing others to 
work without disturbance.
h. Giving prompt and meaningful feedback
Students need immediate and appropriate feedback to benefit from classroom processes 
and improve their learning. Feedback helps students to reflect on what they have learned 
and what they still need to know.  
Providing feedback means giving students an explanation of what they are doing correctly 
and incorrectly, with the focus of the feedback on what the student is doing right. Waiting 
too long to give feedback, the student might not connect the feedback with the learning 
moment. It is vital that we take into consideration each individual when giving student 
feedback. Some students need to be nudged to achieve at a higher level and other needs to 
be handled gently so as not to discourage learning and damage self-esteem.
3.3.4 Planning for Teaching
Teaching is a deliberate act carried out with the intention of bringing about learning in children. 
This deliberate act needs to be well planned. Planning is central to good teaching. Planning in-
cludes construction and organization of classroom tasks as per competencies and outcomes to 
be achieved, pedagogy to be followed, resources to be used and assessment to be carried out. 
Planning also includes support activities for children, home assignments, and displays in the 
class relevant to what is being taught.
Good planning requires understanding of Aims of Education, Curricular Goals, Competencies 
and Learning Outcomes to be achieved along with prior learning of the children for whom the 
plan is being made, and available teaching learning materials and content to be used.
75
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part A
The major components of a teaching plan are: 
a. Competencies, Learning Outcomes and intended lesson objectives
b. Teacher-directed, Teacher-guided and/or Student-led activities to achieve objectives. 
c. Prior understanding of the student on which choice of pedagogy is based
d. Content and material to be used
e. Duration and sequence of activities
f. Classroom arrangements e.g., seating, displays, arrangement of material
g. Specific strategies for students who need extra help
h. Methods of assessment
Box A-3.3-v 
Panchaadi – Five-Step Learning Process
The five-step learning process - ‘Panchaadi’ - is a good guide to formulating the sequence 
that a Teacher may adopt in planning for instruction:
Aditi (Introduction): As a first step, the Teacher introduces a new concept/topic by estab-
lishing a connection with the child’s prior knowledge. Children gather relevant information 
regarding the new topic with the help of the Teacher by asking questions, exploring, and 
experimenting with ideas and material.
Bodh (Conceptual Understanding): Children try to understand core concepts through 
play, enquiry, experiments, discussion, or reading in the second step. The Teacher observes 
the process and guides the children. The teaching plan has the list of concepts to be learnt 
by the children.
Abhyas (Practice): The third step is about practice to strengthen understanding and skills 
through a range of interesting activities. Teachers can organize group work or small proj-
ects to reinforce conceptual understanding and attainment of competencies.
Prayog (Application): The fourth step is about applying the acquired understanding in the 
child’s everyday life. This can be accomplished through various activities and small projects.
Prasar (Expansion): The fifth step is about spreading the acquired understanding through 
conversations with friends, telling each other new stories, singing new songs, reading new 
books together and playing new games with each other. For each and every new topic 
learnt, a neural pathway is created in our brain. Sharing knowledge strengthens our learn-
ing. A neural pathway is incomplete if we don’t teach what we have learnt. Teaching makes 
learning clear and long-lasting.
3.3.5 Managing Classrooms/Student Behaviour
Students behave inappropriately for many reasons. Behaviour is often the unspoken language 
through which young children act out feelings and thoughts. Sometimes they use behaviour to 
seek extra attention. Adolescents could be angry or helpless and don’t know any other way to 
express this. Sometimes this behaviour could be because of lack of sleep, poor nutrition, health 
reasons or developmental delay or deficits, family dysfunctionality or stress.
76
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part A
Norms, rules, and conventions must enable students’ learning. Evolving clear classroom norms 
that can be implemented, would help everyone own them rather than have a classroom function 
on the basis of fear.
Instances of indiscipline must be seen through the lens of development with a balance of humour 
and careful intervention that is firm yet kind. These should be used as learning opportunities in 
helping students to solve problems. 
Discipline must be seen from the lens of self-regulation and self-discipline and as a necessary 
condition for development and the pursuit of learning. It is important for students to take re-
sponsibility for their behaviour and face appropriate consequences as they grow older.
Adults bear greater responsibility than students in creating an environment of respect and 
equality, illustratively, school staff is expected to intervene if they see students using physical 
violence, bullying each other or being unkind/unfair to each other and must put a stop to it im-
mediately and firmly. They must encourage students to settle differences of opinion through di-
alogue and communication.
Box A-3.3-vi 
Importance of Concentration
The Taittiriya Upanishad says that the secret of learning lies in the power of concentration 
in thought. The science of Yoga is based on the process of concentration and the methods by 
which concentration can be achieved on the object of knowledge in order that the contents, 
powers, and states of knowledge concerning that object can be realised by the seeker.
Sri Aurobindo also lays central importance on concentration and speaks of four principal 
methods by which concentration can be attained - meditation, contemplation, witnessing 
the passage of thoughts as they pass through the mind, and quietening and silencing the 
mind. 
Concentration is a psychological process - it involves no rituals or ceremonies and is free 
from any doctrines. Hence, the cultivation of the powers of concentration is independent of 
any activity necessitating faith, belief, or religious prescription.
3.3.6 Responding to Students with Disability or other  
  
Individual Learning Needs
Classroom processes should respond to the diverse needs of students. Students learn best when 
they are challenged but not so much that they feel threatened or overwhelmed by the level of 
challenge. Therefore, Teachers would need to know and understand the learning needs of every 
student in their class and provide the appropriate level of challenge and support to each student.  
During the normal course of teaching, based on routine observations and assessments, Teachers 
could identify those students that may require additional support or individualized attention. 
This in no way should lead to labelling of students as “bright”, “slow” or “problem” students nor 
does it imply “lowering” of standards.  
77
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part A
Some of the ways in which this additional support could be provided or children could be offered 
varying levels of challenge are listed below.  
a. A “bridge” course for a month or so at the beginning of the year which will enable students 
to refresh their previously learnt concepts and prepare for the new class.
b. Specific work on designated days to supplement what has been done in class.
c. Differentiated assignments - the teacher could provide assignments/lass tests of varying 
levels of difficulty using the same content 
d. Making specific resources available to students who need them; extra worksheets for those 
who need additional practice; “extra-challenging” worksheets for those who need it 
e. Set up a buddy system wherever appropriate - pair a child who needs help with another 
child who can provide it informally – e.g., help with homework, explanations after class, 
doing projects together. 
f. Setting up a conference time once a month or so with every student in class so that the 
teacher has a chance to communicate one-on-one with every student and identify 
conceptual problems or learning difficulties or individual needs of all children.
g. Communicate regularly with all parents but particularly those parents whose students may 
need special help and support so that parents are also able to provide support when 
required - the nature of this communication needs to be specific and clear to parents so that 
they know and understand what needs to be done to help their child 
i. 
In cases where the school is not equipped to help or support a student with an 
identified disability adequately, it may rely on external resources or resource persons. 
Schools will understand and opt for all exemptions provided by Boards of Education in 
specific situations. All such decisions should be made in partnership with families. 
3.3.7 Pedagogy across Stages
An effective approach to pedagogy in particular School Stages is based on how children grow and 
learn (i.e., physical, emotional, social and ethical, and cognitive development) and the overall 
aims of education to be attained through school education. Such an approach will help to achieve 
Curricular Goals, Competencies, and Learning Outcomes without compromising the holistic and 
expansive notion of individual development that the NEP 2020 focuses on. 
As stated earlier in this document, while the Stages are distinct, students’ growth and matura-
tion are part of a gradual transition with overlaps and commonalities, especially across two ad-
jacent Stages (e.g., teaching for sensorial and perceptual ways of learning in the Foundational 
and Preparatory Stages, and teaching independent learning habits and discerning use of media 
gadgets in the Middle and Secondary Stages). It can also be seen that some changes occur in a 
continued fashion over the same facets within physical, emotional, social and ethical, and cogni-
tive development over the Stages (e.g., changes in physical strength and flexibility, in expressed 
need for emotional support, in the need for conformity and peer approval, and in abstract think-
ing and independent reasoning abilities).   
78
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part A
a. Pedagogical considerations related to physical development
i. 
Foundational Stage: Early years of school are formative and crucial in paving a 
positive experience of the learning environment. Any teaching strategy in this Stage 
that speaks to vibrant energies, enables playful interactions, engages in enjoyable 
stories, uses curious toys, and allows for full-body engagement with learning would be 
ideal and effective. Children continuously engage through their senses and make the 
understand most of the world around them this way. Pedagogy that encourages them to 
engage physically in aesthetic experiences of music, dance, arts, and crafts makes for an 
enjoyable school day. Teaching about health and hygiene practices ensures physical 
well-being in the long term.  
ii. Preparatory Stage: Students continue to be physically active, highly perceptual, and  
engage with hands-on activities and make sense of concepts with the help of concrete 
physical learning aids. This requires Teachers to demonstrate energetic and active 
participation in the things the students are required to do as part of their learning. The 
Teacher needs to teach through modelling how to make sense of concepts more 
perceptually and practically with low levels of verbal complexity and theorising. The 
content that is chosen, the teaching plan, assessment, and classroom arrangement 
would need to be activity-based, playfully experimental, and lend themselves to a 
conversation and consolidation after ‘doing’.
iii. Middle Stage: This is a Stage of both gradual and sudden changes in physical 
development. With adolescence and prepubescence on the cards, Teachers will need to 
be prepared for handling growth pains and growth spurts with changes in strength and 
increased restlessness in their students. A good understanding of gender and sexuality 
would also help Teachers understand their students better. Understanding families and 
local culture will help with understanding student behaviour in school. It is also a time 
when students must be encouraged to independently practice their learning despite the 
resistance that might come up.
iv. Secondary Stage: At this Stage, students grapple with their changing bodies, may 
become self-conscious, and may be trying to make sense of their maturation. Pedagogy 
across subjects must accommodate for changes in students’ perceptions of their bodies 
and abilities, provide adequately challenging physical tasks, and encourage greater 
participation in both group and individual activities, especially sports and games.     
b. Pedagogical considerations related to emotional development
i. 
Foundational Stage: Children would require Teachers to help them learn about 
understanding their own emotions and the emotions of others. The context of a school 
allows for a safe space for such conversation and learning. Learning to regulate feelings 
and behaviour, delaying the need for instant gratification, and practicing positive 
learning habits will go a long way in the lives of children so these aspects must be 
facilitated and encouraged actively and regularly. Children will require close 
individualised attention and care.
79
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part A
ii. Preparatory Stage: Students at this Stage are also rapidly learning to make sense of 
their thoughts and feelings and would need guidance with learning emotional 
regulation. Many of them would already display temperaments and preferences and 
Teachers will need to engage and tease out emotional habits coming in the way of 
learning through their teaching interactions and provide alternative possibilities to the 
emotional experiences of the students. Gradually, students must be supported and 
encouraged to become emotionally independent.
iii. Middle Stage: The classroom and the school as a site for emotional learning, growth, 
and expression are probably the most occupying for Teachers at the Stage. Students 
themselves go through unpredictable mood states and energy fluctuations, often 
grappling with a sense of unexplainable wellness or not-so-wellness. Middle Stage 
pedagogy must allow for some amount of engagement with emotional experiences 
through quiet discussion and reflection. Curricular areas can be used as contexts in 
which individual responses can be parsed. The Teacher will have to find a balance in the 
approach to students’ emotions - an approach that is neither intrusive nor indulgent, 
but reasonably firm, rationally clear, and emotionally caring towards students of this 
Stage.
iv. Secondary Stage: It would be necessary for pedagogic strategies to guide individual 
reflection and group conversation on thoughts and feelings that emerge through 
engaging with curricular components. A philosophical understanding that feelings are 
transient and not set in stone, that individuals can act upon their emotions in healthy 
and unhealthy ways, and the social consequences of rational versus irrational decision-
making based on emotional reactions are good discussions to have at this Stage.  The 
focus on emotional regulation must continue. Teachers will have to be discerning about 
when students require one-on-one attention and find ways to communicate with them 
effectively.  
c. Pedagogical considerations related to social and ethical development
i. 
Foundational Stage: Teaching social norms and strategies to adhere to them, teaching 
valuable social participation and contribution in accomplishing simple tasks, and 
teaching the meaning of cooperation and respect for others are all immensely 
important in social and ethical development at the Foundational Stage. Social life is a 
long-lasting reality that children must learn to intelligently navigate early on. Ethical 
and moral instructions at this Stage are aimed at teaching children simply the ‘good’ 
and appropriate from the ‘bad’ and inappropriate actions.
ii. Preparatory Stage: This Stage is also a time for learning about social participation and 
contribution. The pedagogic strategies must enable pair work, small group work, and 
individual work in mixed proportions so that students are actively learning to work 
together with sensitivity, mutual respect and listening, are learning to cooperate, and 
also accept cultural differences and diversity of approaches in thinking and feeling. 
Teachers must engage students with basic ethical and moral questions about equality, 
fairness, sharing, and cooperation.   
iii. Middle Stage: Peers seem to become far more prominent in the lives of students at this 
point and this can be leveraged to the advantage of the learning atmosphere. Like the 
Preparatory Stage, the pedagogic strategies here too must plan for pair work, small 
80
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part A
group work, and individual work in good proportions. Mixed small group work would 
allow for listening to and thinking together with different people. Many lessons must 
allow for such learning to work together with others, for healthy ways of testing one’s 
abilities through social facilitation and respectful and sportive competition. The 
pedagogy must explicitly aim (through content selection and interactional strategies) at 
fostering sensitivity and respect for diversity in gender, class, and cultural difference. 
Students will need to learn to navigate their social world (including parents, teachers, 
and community) and will require clear expectations and rules set in these interactions. 
Teachers could discuss equity and respect for others as part of ethical reflection in 
class. It is also a time when they start learning about the world as much bigger than 
their immediate surroundings, so it is important to give them a sense of the cultural 
diversity that they are part of in our historically, geographically, and culturally rich 
country.
iv. Secondary Stage: Students at this Stage are young people with emerging opinions and 
loyal allegiances, and capacities for energetic participation and vehement dissent. 
Forming strong allegiances, explicit interest in varied ideologies that one can identify 
with, idealising individuals (from politics or sport or the entertainment industry) and 
other similar impulses seem to show up in this age group based on the need for 
belongingness in students. Actual friendships, tightly knit small groups (ingroups and 
outgroups), and peer conformity would be features that can be used to the advantage of 
learning about oneself and the world around them. This is also the time to actively 
encourage individuation in thinking and reasoning while being able to respectfully 
listen to and understand others. Challenges like bullying, isolation, and confusion with 
boundaries will need to be met in the context of the classroom and outside. Teaching 
strategies can include delegating responsibilities, allowing students to take charge of 
their own learning, and regulating each other’s learning with a focus on helping others 
to learn better. Teachers could actively talk with students about ethical and moral 
actions connected to social participation and change. It is also an important time in the 
lives of students to address ideas of identity and heritage about what it means to be 
Indian (Bharatiyata) and belong to our vast and culturally rich nation. 
d. Pedagogical considerations related to Cognitive development
i. 
Foundational Stage: Pedagogic strategies for this Stage must ensure literacy and 
numeracy learning for all children as this forms the basis of all further learning. 
Exposure to rich learning experiences in language and mathematics, and rich aesthetic 
and cultural experiences through art, crafts, music, dance, stories, and theatre would 
enable sound overall cognitive development. Multimodal forms of teaching-learning 
materials, adequate outdoor experiences, one-on-one Teacher attention, and physical 
wellness would also address the cognitive developmental needs of children at this 
Stage.  
ii. Preparatory Stage: Pedagogy at this Stage will require a gradual move to more 
thinking and analysing after doing and observation, with plenty of material to engage 
with, repeat, and practice. This repeated practice will form the basis for study habits, 
independent thinking, and independent learning that is to come in the Middle Stage. 
81
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part A
Multimodal teaching-learning material and one-on-one attention are still necessary to a 
good extent at this Stage, as these strategies will form a strong conceptual basis for 
students across curricular areas. Planning for field visits in the various subjects, 
apportioning sufficient time outdoors in a working week, encouraging students to 
demonstrate logic in their reasoning, encouraging thoughtful questioning, learning 
skills to inquire through conversations with people and reading/referring to books are 
important pedagogical strategies in this phase.  
iii. Middle Stage: This Stage often demonstrates the most accelerated learning 
possibilities - individual learning abilities begin to show sharply in distinction from 
others. This will require pedagogic attention, especially for those who struggle and for 
those who excel in their achievement levels given the context of group learning 
processes. Teaching students how to assimilate understanding and shifting from 
practical to theoretical concepts across curricular areas, demanding greater rigour in, 
and capacity for, working would be essential pedagogic considerations at this point.  
With the introduction of newer curricular areas, it would be important to create 
adequate scaffolds for students to keep their interest and confidence in their 
intellectual capacities. Students’ capacity for abstract thinking improves markedly and 
Teachers can present challenging material that requires abstract reasoning and 
application. Rules for technology and media usage become necessary in this Stage. 
Teachers need to demonstrate in their teaching transactions (and explicitly teach) a 
discerning educational use of the internet and media gadgets in learning. This would 
require conversations about safe and healthy practices in using the internet, new media 
technology, and gadgets in the context of the curriculum.
iv. Secondary Stage: There exist ample possibilities for maturation in thinking, learning, 
practising, and creative expression in this Stage spread over four years of student life. 
Teaching students how to independently assimilate understanding and encouraging 
abstraction and theoretical concepts across curricular areas, demanding rigour in 
working and presenting their views would be very important pedagogical 
considerations for Secondary students. Newer curricular areas and choices in 
specialisations begin at this Stage, it would be important to help them make their 
decisions (in subject choices) and create adequate opportunities to sustain practice in 
these. Given their age and independence, technology and media use rules will need 
strong follow-up and reminders. As less supervision is possible, and the ‘discerning 
educational use of the internet and media gadgets in learning’ principle taught in the 
previous Stage is likely to wane, this will require repeated reminders. Caution against 
distractions while learning, cyberbullying, compulsive use and many other unhealthy 
practices in using the internet will be required from Teachers especially, as students 
will be engaging with online research for learning much more in this Stage.

3.3.8 Overall Principles of Pedagogy
Given all of the above, the following principles of pedagogy must inform classroom planning and 
instruction across all Stages: 
a. Every child is capable of learning. Children are natural learners. 
b. Learning is an active process that involves both understanding and doing. 
c. Children learn best when they are respected, valued, and involved in the learning process.
d. Children learn in a variety of ways, illustratively, through making something, discussion, 
listening, speaking, reading, writing, questioning, exploring, discovering, experimenting.
e. Learning happens best when classroom processes make connections with the life of 
students and their prior experiences, focus on conceptual clarity, and provide variety and 
challenge to students.  
f. Practice is a critical and integral part of the learning process. 
 The following are non-negotiable:
a. Punishment and fear are detrimental to learning and must not be used in the classroom 
b. Inequity in the classroom on the basis of caste, gender, religion, socio-economic conditions, 
student performance or any other factor is unacceptable
c. Rote memorization must not be the primary form of learning or of assessment
d. Students must not be treated as passive receivers of information - this makes classroom 
processes lead to boredom and monotonous routines
Effective pedagogy, therefore, encourages conceptual understanding, active discovery, and inde-
pendent learning, gives serious consideration to student experiences and student voices, ac-
knowledges and accommodates student diversity, builds on students’ previous knowledge, uses 
a range of teaching techniques, and gives timely feedback on work done.

Section 3.4 
 Approach to Assessment
The aim of assessment in the culture of our schooling system will shift from one that is summative 
and primarily tests rote memorization skills to one that is more regular and formative, is more 
competency-based, promotes learning and development for our students, and tests higher-order 
skills, such as analysis, critical thinking, and conceptual clarity. The primary purpose of assessment 
will indeed be for learning; it will help the teacher and student, and the entire schooling system, 
continuously revise teaching-learning processes to optimize learning and development for all stu-
dents. This will be the underlying principle for assessment at all levels of education. [NEP 2020, 
4.34]
The progress card will be a holistic, 360-degree, multidimensional report that reflects in great de-
tail the progress as well as the uniqueness of each learner in the cognitive, affective, and psychomo-
tor domains. It will include self-assessment and peer assessment, and progress of the child in project 
based and inquiry-based learning, quizzes, role plays, group work, portfolios, etc., along with teach-
er assessment. The holistic progress card will form an important link between home and school and 
will be accompanied by parent-teacher meetings in order to actively involve parents in their chil-
dren’s holistic education and development. The progress card would also provide teachers and par-
ents with valuable information on how to support each student in and out of the classroom. AI-
based software could be developed and used by students to help track their growth through their 
school years based on learning data and interactive questionnaires for parents, students, and 
teachers, in order to provide students with valuable information on their strengths, areas of inter-
est, and needed areas of focus, and to thereby help them make optimal career choices.” [NEP 2020, 
4.35]
3.4.1 Purposes of Assessment 
Assessment has two purpose - measuring achievement of student learning and gauging effective-
ness of classroom processes and teaching materials in teaching and learning. 
In the everyday of the classroom, assessment refers to any process of gathering information 
about student learning that can be interpreted, analysed, and used by the Teacher (mainly) for 
guiding the teaching-learning process, aggregating student learning at relevant junctures and in 
reporting student progress over time. 
Educational assessment, thus, plays a critical role in improving teaching and learning. 
Assessment is also used for certifying student learning and education completion at key stages 
(e.g., Grade 10, Grade 12).  
84
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part A
3.4.2 Assessment of Learning; Assessment for Learning;  
  
Assessment as Learning
Assessment of learning refers to. the measurement of achievement of student learning. 
Assessment for learning refers to evidence of student learning gathered by the Teacher that pro-
vides inputs to guide the teaching-learning processes. Assessment, when designed meaningfully, 
can be used as a powerful tool that contributes to and supports better student learning and 
teaching practices. Teachers who have a good sense of where students in class do well and where 
they struggle, can thus take more informed decisions about their pedagogical practices. 
Recent studies have shown that students can play an active role in taking charge of their own 
learning. When assessments are introduced as non-threatening tools for self-reflection and in-
trospection, they become developmental and constructive in nature. This is referred to as assess-
ments as learning. 
In school education, one needs to look at all three approaches to assessments mentioned above 
- assessment of learning, for learning and as learning.
3.4.3 Current Challenges in Assessment 
In school, assessment has mostly become mechanical and routinized. At best, assessment is fo-
cused on measuring rote learning of content rather than measuring achievement of Competen-
cies and Learning Outcomes. At worst, assessment is an intimidating process that creates fear 
and leads to labeling and segregation of students based on the ‘marks’ they have scored in tests 
and examination. 
The stress of Board examinations at Grade 10 and Grade 12 has repeatedly led to deep anxiety 
among students and families. They place an enormous amount of pressure on students over just 
a few days of their lives. Real understanding, thinking, analysing, doing, and learning takes a sec-
ondary seat to rote learning, and obtaining coaching for performing on these life-altering exam-
inations. The fact that life-determining Board Examinations are available only on two occasions, 
in Grade 10 and 12, the pressure on students and families would naturally be high. Also, the 
current structure of Board Examinations forces students to concentrate only on a few subjects at 
the expense of others, preventing truly holistic development. Examinations should also be seen 
as learning experiences, from which one can learn and improve in the future, the current Board 
Examination system does not lend itself to this.
3.4.4 Key Principles of Good Assessment 
Key principles that could guide our thinking on effective use of assessments to aid better teach-
ing and learning are listed below:
a. Assessment should measure achievement of Competencies and Learning Outcomes 
leading to attainment of Curricular Goals 
Assessments should explicitly track student progress on all aspects of learning as stated in 
the Competencies for each Stage and Learning Outcomes for each Grade. Assessments 
should accurately reflect the intent of evaluating the achievement of a Competency or 
85
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part A
Learning Outcome. The connection between the Competency or Learning Outcome and the 
assessment should be clear and precise. Appropriate modes of assessments may be chosen 
in alignment with the Competencies and Learning Outcome to be assessed.
b. Assessments should be constructive, developmental, and learning focused
Assessments need to be visualized as an ongoing process which Teachers integrate within 
the teaching learning process using formal and informal ways to elicit reliable evidence 
about student learning. Collecting such evidence helps Teachers understand the effective-
ness of their pedagogy in terms of what the students have understood and what needs to be 
worked on further; which methods of teaching work and which ones don’t; what kind of 
resources work, and so on. For students, assessments need to be placed as an important 
tool that will help them understand and reflect on their own learning. Assessment should 
not become an intimidating process that involves the labelling and segregation of students.
c. Assessments should be Stage-appropriate  
At the Foundational Stage, Teachers would primarily drive all assessment activities which 
are largely based on observation. At the Preparatory and Middle Stages, students need to be 
given a more proactive role in assessing their own learning trajectories. Multiple tools and 
methods can be introduced at these Stages. At the Secondary Stage, students should be 
prepared to take standardized tests including Board certifications and other competitive 
assessments that will prepare them for the future. 
d. Assessments should accommodate student diversity
It is important to move away from the one size fits all approach while designing assess-
ments. To the extent possible, classroom assessments should be graded in terms of the 
learning outcomes and competencies to be achieved. As the rate of learning progression for 
each student can differ, the tools must accommodate for students performing at different 
levels in a classroom. Well-designed graded assessments can be used to understand individ-
ual student needs better so that they can be adequately catered to. Another way of address-
ing student diversity is also through using variety of assessment methods, e.g., paper-pencil 
tests, oral assessments, project work, group assignments.
e. Assessments should be supported by timely, credible, and constructive feedback to 
students
Students should be given adequate feedback on their performance. Such feedback needs to 
be constructive with information on what has worked well and what areas might need 
improvement and how can this be achieved. Use of Holistic Progress Cards that detail out 
student performance in multiple aspects including formative and summative assessments 
should be explored.
f. Assessments should support in meaningful aggregation/summation of student 
learning
While the formative function of assessment is critical, the summative function of assess-
ment is equally important. Summative examinations, including certification examinations, 
continue to be relevant as it serves as a necessary test to understand student’s achievement 
of Competencies and Learning Outcomes. While the significance of summative exams is well 
established, what needs immediate attention is the approach to the same. Examinations 
should move away from testing rote learning skills and instead focus conceptual under-
standing, application of concepts, problem solving abilities, critical thinking, and other such 
higher order capacities.
86
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part A
3.4.5 Types of Assessment
Assessments could be formative or summative, both are equally important for improving teach-
ing and learning.
a. Formative assessments are continuous and ongoing. They are used to track student 
learning to provide ongoing feedback that can be used by both Teachers to improve their 
teaching and students to improve their learning. Formative assessments are generally low 
stakes and do not have strong consequences. Some examples of formative assessments 
include observing student behaviour in class, asking students to draw a concept map in 
class to represent their understanding of a topic or write a few sentences with a friend on a 
poem they have read. 
b. Summative assessments evaluate student learning at the end of a lesson or a logical 
period of teaching. Summative assessments are normally high stakes in that they compare 
student performance to a benchmark or standard and have some consequence.  Some 
examples of summative assessments include a term-end test, submission of a project or 
writing a paper. Results of summative assessment can also be used for formative purposes 
i.e., informing teaching and learning.
3.4.6 Assessment across Stages
3.4.6.1 
Foundational Stage 
a. Assessment should not contribute to any additional burden for the child. Assessment tools 
and processes should be designed such that they are a natural extension of the learning 
experience for the child. Explicit tests and examinations are completely inappropriate 
assessment tools for this Stage.
b. Assessment should allow for diversity among children and in their learning. Children learn 
differently and express their learning differently too. There might be many ways to assess 
the achievement of a Learning Outcome or Competency. The Teacher should have the ability 
to design different kinds of assessment for the same Learning Outcome and use each 
assessment appropriately. 
c. Assessment should enable recording and documentation. Children’s progress should be 
described and analysed through systematic collection of evidence.
d. Assessment should not overly burden the Teacher. The Teacher should have the autonomy 
to judiciously choose the appropriate tool for assessment and the periodicity in which 
assessment-related record keeping is maintained. While such autonomy is important, 
systematic record keeping of children’s assessment should be seen as an important part of a 
Teacher’s professional responsibilities.
e. The two important methods of assessment that are appropriate for the Foundational Stage 
are observations of the child and analysing artefacts that the child has produced as part of 
their learning experience. 
87
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part A
3.4.6.2 
Preparatory Stage
a. With the start of more formal learning across curricular areas, a robust system of formative 
assessment is required to track progress of individual students. Assessment should act as 
an instructional tool and help to provide a comprehensive account of student learning. 
b. Students from this Stage onwards learn better when they are more aware of the 
Competencies to be attained. Teachers should help make them understand the desired 
Competency to be achieved through a lesson or a unit of study. 
c. A variety of assessment methods should be used to promote learning. Written tests should 
be introduced at this Stage. Portfolios can be used to capture student progress holistically 
through their work. This could also provide a reliable picture of their learning to parents. 
Peer and Self-assessments could also be introduced to help students monitor the trajectory 
of their own learning. 
d. At the end of the Preparatory Stage, there should be a comprehensive summative 
assessment of the student’s readiness to enter the Middle Stage where several new 
curricular areas are introduced. 
3.4.6.3 
Middle Stage
a. With the introduction of more concepts in each subject at this Stage, assessment will 
continue to be Competency-based, covering all dimensions of learning. 
b. At this Stage, the focus of the curriculum moves to conceptual understanding and higher 
order capacities. Therefore, classroom assessment techniques such as projects, debates, 
presentations, experiments, investigations, role plays, journals and portfolios should be 
used to assess learning. 
c. Regular summative assessments at this Stage will help students synthesize their learning at 
logical intervals (e.g., year-end, term-end, unit of learning-end). Summative assessments 
comprising multiple-choice questions and constructed responses (e.g., short answer, long 
answer) may be used periodically. 
d. By the end of the Middle Stage, there should be a comprehensive summative assessment of 
student achievement of Competencies in each curricular area. The assessments should also 
be able to indicate special interest or inclination in specific curricular areas that students 
may have demonstrated. 
3.4.6.4 
Secondary Stage
a. Given the demand of greater subject depth, comprehensive classroom assessments should 
be effectively practiced for facilitating meaningful learning and constructive feedback. 
Regular summative assessments should be conducted for recording students learning 
against Competencies. 
b. Classroom assessments, like in the Middle Stage, will continue to play important role 
considering the nature and complexity of the Competencies at this Stage. Self-assessment 
will play a key role in student learning at this Stage. Students should be facilitated to 
monitor what they are learning and use the feedback from this monitoring to adjust, adapt, 
and decide their own strategies for learning. 
88
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part A
c. Summative assessments can be designed using case-based questions, simulations, and 
essay-type questions to enable assessment of Competencies.  
d. At this Stage, students should also be prepared to undertake the Board examinations and 
other selection tests to gain access to higher education and livelihood opportunities. 
3.4.7 Approach to Board Examinations at Grade 10 and  
  
Grade 12
3.4.7.1 
Current Challenges
Board examinations conducted at the end of Grades 10 and 12 are certification examinations to 
ascertain the extent to which students have achieved Competencies across curricular areas lead-
ing to the attainment of Curricular Goals. 
Most Board examinations struggle to do this well in a meaningful and consistent manner. 
a. The examinations most often focus on the capacity of students to reproduce learnt facts and 
little else. This issue of misalignment between what these examinations should test and 
what they do test (i.e., validity of the test) is quite common. Given that most examinations 
largely test rote memory, a very narrow range of Competencies are assessed. This gives an 
incomplete (at best) or incorrect (at worst) picture of student learning. Most test 
instruments are not backed by clear and detailed marking schemes which leads to 
subjectivity by evaluators and questions of consistency or comparability test scores (i.e., 
reliability of the test).   
b. Students have to take these examinations only when they are offered once a year. There is 
no provision for examinations to be offered more than once so that students can either take 
them when they are ready or get a second chance if they miss the examination.  
3.4.7.2 
Changes in Board Examinations
a. Board examinations should assess the achievement of Competencies for the Secondary 
Stage as stated in the Curriculum. These examinations should provide a valid and reliable 
picture of student performance as per the Competencies in the Curriculum.
b. It is the responsibility of Boards of Examination is to design and implement fair, reliable and 
valid testing processes, and instruments to assess achievement of the articulated 
Competencies and certify students on the basis of this achievement.   As per NEP 2020, 
Boards of Examination should have no role in the design of the Curriculum or the 
articulation of Competencies. This is the responsibility of the appropriate academic 
authority (e.g., NCERT or SCERT). 
c. Board examinations should be offered at least twice a year to ensure that students have 
both enough time and opportunity to perform well. Students can then appear for a Board 
examination in courses they have completed and feel ready for. This process could be made 
possible through the creation of a comprehensive test item bank which can be used to 
create tests using suitable software. This will enable the move towards a system of on-
demand examinations in the near future as described in NEP 2020. 
89
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part A
d. Selection of test developers, reviewers, translators, and evaluators for Board Examinations 
should be based on a rigorous process based on detailed guidelines. Boards of Examination 
should ensure that all test developers, reviewers and evaluators go through formal 
University-certified courses on test development before they begin this work. In addition, 
there should be ongoing capacity building of test developers, evaluators, and reviewers to 
support them in the design of high-quality test instruments.
e. Vocational Education, Arts Education and Physical Education are an integral part of the 
curriculum in this NCF. Boards of Examination will need to design high-quality test 
instruments for these curricular areas for certification at Grade 10 and Grade 12. Since 
these areas will have a significant practice component, they will need to be assessed very 
differently from what is normally done.   
f. Test development processes for written examinations should be significantly streamlined. 
Some illustrative steps are given below:
i. 
Creating Assessment frameworks is the first step to start the process. Assessment 
frameworks ensure a well-articulated basis for deciding what to test and what not to. 
Such frameworks detail out the Competencies, Learning Outcomes and content 
domains to be assessed. 
ii. Designing a blueprint based on the assessment framework is the next step.  A blueprint 
is a planning document where all the relevant information for a test is listed. The 
blueprint is usually a working document which undergoes change during the process of 
test item designing. The information in the blueprint includes Competencies, Learning 
Outcomes and content domains to be tested, format of test items (e.g., multiple choice, 
short written answers, others), length of the test, and marking schemes.
iii. Designing good quality test items and scoring guides is the third step. Broadly, test item 
formats are of two kinds - Selected Response questions (e.g., Multiple Choice Questions, 
True/False) where student must select the correct response from the options provided 
and Constructed Response questions where the student must develop the correct 
response. Some important quality parameters to be kept in mind while designing test 
items are language clarity, factual accuracy, quality of distractors, choice of stimulus 
materials (e.g., graphics, illustrations, maps) used.  The scoring guides are as important 
as the test items themselves. 
iv. Once test items are developed, rigorous review procedures (e.g., item panelling with an 
expert group) should be ensured. Scoring guides should also be reviewed along with 
test items. 
v. Boards of examination should ensure periodic, rigorous reviews of the quality of test 
instruments designed.

Section 3.5 
 Illustrative Time Allocation
3.5.1 Foundational Stage
Young children enjoy free time exploring their immediate environment. However, as they grow 
older, they also need organised activities that are play-based but guided and structured. 
The day needs to be carefully organised so that all domains of development receive adequate 
time and attention. While activities of each domain of development are connected with other 
domains (e.g., a good story will help language development as well as socio-emotional and ethi-
cal development), the routine must ensure that children get ample opportunity for a range of 
experiences in every domain.
a. Considerations for the Daily Routine 
The organisation of the day is based on the institutional setting and the number of working 
days, and daily working hours for each day.  
Each activity may be planned keeping in mind the attention span of the child. There may be 
a balance between child-initiated and Teacher-guided activities, group (whole group or 
small group) and individual or pair activities, and alternating activities (e.g., quieter activity 
after physical activity, group activity after individual activity, indoor activity after outdoor 
activity). 
Art and Craft, Outdoor Play and Free Play must have adequate time and focus in the 
day.
b. Illustrative Daily Routine for Ages 3-6
There are multiple ways to organise the daily routine for children of ages 3-6.  
Two illustrations given below.  
The first illustration is more appropriate in contexts where experiences like Circle Time, 
Story Time, Concept Time/Pre-numeracy are Teacher-guided and Free Play and Corners 
Time are independent activities for the children.

The second illustration is more appropriate in contexts with fewer children and a range of ap-
propriate material available for them to use. Emphasis is on self-learning and children learn to 
use materials independently and with care.
‘Work Time’ is allotted for children to independently choose the activity they would like to en-
gage with. Children select activities of their choice and work with materials for those activities 
independently. Teachers observe children’s activities and extend support as and when required. 
Teachers also decide and present the next activity to an individual child based on the observa-
tions during Work Time. Activities and the corresponding materials are arranged according to 
the domains of development (e.g., Physical, Cognitive, Language, Arts) and children are made 
familiar with this arrangement.

c. Illustrative Daily/Weekly Routine for Ages 6-8 
The daily routine for ages 6-8 would be slightly longer and a little more structured.  
While for ages 3-6, all languages can be handled together; for this age group, dedicated time 
for each language is necessary. Specific blocks of time for literacy, numeracy and arts can be 
incorporated. L1 would need 90 minutes every day and L2 would need 60 minutes. Mathe-
matics and numeracy would require 60 minutes a day. These periods of time can be orga-
nized into blocks as described in Chapter 4.

3.5.2 Considerations for time allocation across Preparatory,  
  
Middle and Secondary Stages
a. The annual working year for schools has 220 instruction/school-going days after taking 
into consideration national holidays, term breaks, and vacations.  
b. Of these 220 days, around 20 days may be considered for assessments and other 
assessment-related activities across Stages.
c. Another 20 days may be set aside for school events and other similar activities (or as buffer 
for less foreseeable events) in schools.
d. Therefore, a safe estimate can be of 180 days of instruction time across these three Stages at 
school.
e. Given the wide range of contexts in which schools operate across the country, a working 
school week has been taken as five and a half days (with Saturdays as half working days).
f. Since not all Saturdays are likely to be working for all students, the model here has 
considered five and a half days of school every alternate week only.
g. Given the range of subjects in the different Stages, and the reasonable number of hours 
students can spend in school,  a working school year would have around 34 working weeks 
of around 29 hours of instruction hours every week.
3.5.3 Stage-specific considerations  
3.5.3.1 
Time Allocation for the Preparatory Stage
a. Weekdays begin with an assembly for 25 minutes with 05 minutes to reach the classroom. 
b. Class time for all subjects is 40 minutes. Some subjects will require a block period of 80 
minutes (1 hour 20 minutes). 
c. The transition time for students to prepare for the next class is 05 minutes. 
d. The two working Saturdays a month have a slightly different schedule compared to other 
working weekdays. No assembly on Saturdays.
e. A snack break of 15 minutes and a lunch break of 45 minutes has been built in (see the 
illustrative timetable) on weekdays. Lunch is 30 minutes on Saturdays.
f. R1 Language has Curricular Goals for the Library built into it in the design of Learning 
Standards. Therefore, the time is shared between these two subjects on the timetable.
g. R2 has been given more time than R1 in the year as gaining proficiency in the language over 
this Stage will require additional time. Also, all other curricular areas are in the language of 
R1 and add to the learning of R1.  R2 has also been given more time than Mathematics as 
the Preparatory Stage is a developmentally critical time to hone the newer language skills 
and Mathematics has been in the curriculum for around 8 years already.

Time Allocation for the Middle Stage
a. The weekday begins with an assembly for 25 minutes with 05 minutes to reach the 
classroom.
b. Class time for all subjects is 40 minutes. Some subjects will require a block period of 80 
minutes (1 hour 20 minutes) for activities, lab work, and other such pedagogic 
requirements. 
c. The transition time for students to prepare for the next class is 05 minutes. 
d. The two working Saturdays a month have a slightly different schedule compared to other 
working weekdays. No assembly on Saturdays.
e. A snack break of 15 minutes and a lunch break of 45 minutes has been built in (see the 
illustrative timetable) on weekdays. Lunch is 30 minutes on Saturdays.
f. R1 Language has Curricular Goals for the Library built into it in the design of Learning 
Standards. Therefore, the time is shared between these two subjects on the timetable.
g. R3 Language gets introduced in the Middle Stage and requires moderate amounts of time to 
develop basic interpersonal communications skills only. On the whole, R2 receives more 
time than R1 as by the end of the Middle Stage, students must be at the same level of 
proficiency in R1 and R2.
h. Science, Social Science, and Vocational Education as new curricular areas have been given a 
fair share of their time considering the Learning Standards built into this curricular 
framework.

5. Foundational Stage in the NCF
The Foundational Stage is for children between the ages of 3 to 8 years. Children start schooling 
in this Stage. This chapter summarizes the characteristics and importance of this curricular 
stage, the learning standards – curricular goals, competencies, and illustrative learning outcomes 
– and the suggested content, pedagogy, and assessment for this stage. The National Curricular 
Framework for the Foundational Stage (NCF-FS) deals with all these in detail.

Section 1.1   
Criticality of the Early Years/Early          
Childhood Care and Education
The first eight years of a child’s life are truly critical and lay the foundation for lifelong well-be-
ing, and overall growth and development across all dimensions - physical, cognitive, and so-
cio-emotional.
The pace of brain development in the first eight years of a child’s life is more rapid than at any 
other stage of a person’s life. Research from neuroscience informs us that over 85% of an indi-
vidual’s brain development occurs by the age of 6, indicating the critical importance of appropri-
ate care and stimulation in a child’s early years to promote sustained and healthy brain develop-
ment and growth.
The most current research also demonstrates that children under the age of 8 tend not to follow 
linear, age-based educational trajectories. It is only at about the age of 8 that children begin to 
converge in their learning trajectories. Even after the age of 8, non-linearity and varied pace con-
tinue to be inherent characteristics of learning and development; however, up to the age of 8, the 
differences are so varied that it is effective to view the age of 8, on average, as a transition point 
from one stage of learning to another. In particular, it is only at about the age of 8 that children 
begin to adapt to more structured learning.
Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) is thus generally defined as the care and education 
of children from birth to eight years.
104
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part B
Section 1.2 
Foundational Stage
1.2.1 Primarily at home-Ages 0-3
Up to 3 years of age, the environment in which most children grow up is in the home with fami-
lies, while some children do go to creches. After the age of 3, a large proportion of children spend 
significant time in institutional settings such as Anganwadis and preschools. Providing high 
quality preschool education in an organised setting for children above 3 years of age is one of the 
key priorities of NEP 2020.
Up to age 3, the home environment is (and should remain) almost the sole provider of adequate 
nutrition, good health practices, responsive care, safety and protection, and stimulation for early 
childhood learning i.e., everything that constitutes and forms the basis for ECCE. After the age of 
3, these components of nutrition, health, care, safety, and stimulation must continue at home, 
and must also be ensured in an appropriate and complementary manner in institutional settings 
such as Anganwadis and preschools.
Appropriate ECCE at home for children under the age of 3 includes not only health, safety, and 
nutrition, but also crucially includes cognitive and emotional care and stimulation of the infant 
through talking, playing, moving, listening to music and sounds, and stimulating all the other 
senses particularly sight and touch so that at the end of three years, optimal developmental out-
comes are attained, in various development domains, including physical and motor, socio-emo-
tional, cognitive, communication, early language, and emergent literacy and numeracy. It must 
be noted that these domains are overlapping and indeed deeply interdependent.
The guidelines and/or suggested practices to enable high-quality ECCE at home for the 
age-group of 0-3 would be developed and disseminated by the Ministry of Woman and 
Child Development (MWCD).
1.2.2 In Institutional Settings: Ages 3-8
During the ages of 3 to 8, appropriate and high-quality ECCE provided in institutional environ-
ments must be available to all children. In India, where available, this is typically carried out as 
follows:
a. 3-6 years: Early childhood education programmes in Anganwadis, Balvatikas, or preschools
b. 6-8 years: Early primary education programmes in school (Grades 1 and 2)
From 3 to 8 years of age, ECCE includes continued attention to health, safety, care, and nutrition; 
but also, crucially, self-help skills, motor skills, hygiene, the handling of separation anxiety, phys-
ical development through movement and exercise, expressing and communicating thoughts and 
feelings to parents and others, being comfortable around one’s peers, sitting for longer periods 
of time in order to work on and complete a task, ethical development, and forming all-round 
good habits.
105
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part B
Supervised play-based education, in groups and individually, is particularly important during 
this age range to nurture and develop the child’s innate abilities and capacities of curiosity, cre-
ativity, critical thinking, cooperation, teamwork, social interaction, empathy, compassion, inclu-
siveness, communication, cultural appreciation, playfulness, awareness of the immediate envi-
ronment, as well as the ability to successfully and respectfully interact with teachers, fellow 
students, and others. 
1.2.3 Importance of Literacy and Numeracy
ECCE during these years also entails the development of early literacy and numeracy, including 
learning about the alphabet, languages, numbers, counting, colours, shapes, drawing/painting, 
indoor and outdoor play, puzzles and logical thinking, art, craft, music, and movement. The aim 
is to build on the developmental outcomes in the domains mentioned above, combined with a 
focus on early literacy, numeracy, and awareness of one’s environment. This becomes particular-
ly important during the age range of 6-8, forming the basis for achievement of Foundational Lit-
eracy and Numeracy (FLN). The importance of FLN to overall education is well-understood, and 
fully emphasized in NEP 2020.
Considering all of the above, NEP 2020 has articulated the age range of 3-8 as the Founda-
tional Stage, in the new 5+3+3+4 system.
106
National Curriculum Framework for School Education

Section 1.3 
Foundational Stage in NEP 2020
The Foundational Stage is a single curricular and pedagogical phase which comprises five years 
of flexible, multilevel, play and activity-based learning for children between 3 and 8 years of age. 
Due to the critical importance of the Foundational Stage for the development of an individual, 
and for the long-term benefit to society as a whole, NEP 2020 articulates a clear goal - that every 
child in the age range of 3–8 years must have access to free, safe, high quality, developmental-
ly-appropriate ECCE by the year 2025.
Regardless of the circumstances of birth or background, quality ECCE enables children to partic-
ipate and flourish in the educational system throughout their lives. ECCE is thus perhaps one of 
the greatest and most powerful equalisers. High-quality ECCE in the Foundational Stage gives 
the best chance for all children to grow into good, ethical, thoughtful, creative, empathetic, and 
productive human beings. 
For the overall well-being and prosperity of our country, all members of our society - from Teach-
ers to school functionaries to parents and community members to policy makers and adminis-
trators - must come together to ensure that every child is provided this all-important physical, 
cognitive, and socio-emotional stimulation, along with appropriate and adequate nutrition, in 
these earliest and most critical years of life.
1.3.1 Key Guiding Principles for the Foundational Stage  
  
based on NEP 2020
a. Every child is capable of learning regardless of the circumstances of birth or background. 
b. Each child is different and grows, learns, and develops at their own pace. 
c. Children are natural researchers with great observational skills. They are constructors of 
their own learning experiences and express feelings and ideas through different 
representations. 
d. Children are social beings; they learn through observation, imitation, and collaboration. 
Children learn through concrete experiences, using their senses and acting upon the 
environment. 
e. Children’s experiences and ways of learning must be acknowledged and included. Children 
learn best when they are respected, valued, and fully involved in the learning process. 
f. Play and activity are the primary ways of learning and development with continuous 
opportunities for children to experience, explore, and experiment with the environment. 
g. Children must engage with material, activities, and environments that are developmentally 
and culturally appropriate and develop conceptual understanding and problem-solving. 
107
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part B
h. Content should be drawn from the experiences of children. The novelty of the content or its 
challenges should be based on the familiar experiences of children. 
i. Content should be suited to the developmental needs of children and should provide several 
opportunities for fantasy, storytelling, art, music, and play. 
j. Equity in issues such as gender, caste, class, and disability should be emphasised in the 
content. 
k. Teachers should facilitate and mediate the learning of the children. Scaffolding should be 
provided by asking open-ended questions, enabling exploration. 
l. Family and community are partners in this process and are involved in multiple ways. 
m. Care is central to learning. Children at this age naturally perceive familiar adults as 
caregivers first. Teachers should be sensitive and responsive to the needs and moods of 
children. Classroom activities must emphasise the emotional aspect of learning (e.g., 
through storytelling or art).
108
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part B
Section 1.4 
How Children Learn at this Stage
Children are natural learners. They are active, eager to learn, and respond with interest in new 
things. They have an innate sense of curiosity - they wonder, question, explore, try out, and dis-
cover to make sense of the world.  By acting on their curiosity, they continue to discover and 
learn more. 
Children learn best through play - through activity and doing. They like to run, jump, crawl, and 
balance, they enjoy repetition, they respond spontaneously to rhythm, they talk, they ask, and 
they reason, and answer questions posed to them. They learn by first-hand experiences involv-
ing manipulation, exploration, and experimentation. 
This playfulness with materials, ideas, thoughts, and feelings helps in developing children’s cre-
ativity, flexible thinking, and problem-solving abilities, and enhances their concentration, atten-
tion, and perseverance. Children improve their thinking, vocabulary, imagination, speaking, and 
listening skills through play, whether they are reconstructing real situations or creating imagi-
nary worlds.  
Learning at this Stage is, therefore, an active and interactive process in which children learn 
through play and through interaction with other children and more experienced others. Children 
are actively engaged in their social and cultural experiences, and they constantly adjust and use 
new information to make sense of their perceptions and their experiences. 
Children’s playing and playfulness can be nurtured and strengthened through experiences of 
active participation with others, and with natural, real-world materials that provoke and en-
hance learning, imagination, creativity, innovation, and problem solving in diverse and unique 
ways. 
It is vital that learning of children at this Stage is anchored by nurturing relationships with those 
around them. These relationships help children feel safe, become more optimistic, curious, and 
communicative. 
1.4.1 Importance of Play
Play is a child’s work. Play by its very nature is something young children like to do and actively 
engage in. We can say that play and learning are a two-way reciprocal process. Play enables 
learning by allowing children to remain active, engaged, and involved in social interaction with 
other adults and children, thus meeting all necessary conditions for learning to occur.
When we observe children engaged in play, we notice the following:
a. There is choice: Children choose and decide their goals when they play (e.g., I would like to 
complete the puzzle, build the block tower, or make tea in the dollhouse). This choice 
enables them to be active and engaged. 
b. There is wonder: This enables them to think and focus (e.g., the balloon is getting so big, 
how far into the sky the kite has gone, where did the handkerchief disappear - is that 
magic?).
109
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part B
c. There is joy: Children are enjoying themselves, are excited about playing, and are loving 
what they are doing. This enables meaningful social interaction and increases the desire to 
continue learning.
In this active playing process, children are learning - learning to make sense of the world, learn-
ing to solve problems, learning about themselves, learning about others, learning language and 
mathematics. 
Play is thus central to children’s learning and development. Learning through play in the class-
room provides several opportunities for children, actively catering to all domains of develop-
ment, all Curricular Goals. Choice, wonder, and joy are key aspects of children’s play, and our 
classrooms would do well to be organized around these three aspects.
1.4.2 Significance of Family and Community
Most children in India grow up surrounded by people within and outside the immediate family. 
While parents play a pivotal role in the child’s growing up, bringing up children is often a shared 
experience with the extended family including grandparents, neighbours, and others in the close 
community. 
The predominant influence during this period are the relationships in the family especially those 
that ensure adequate nutrition, social engagement, and emotional support. Stable, nurturing, 
and responsive families contribute to healthy development and positive learning for children. 
For example, ensuring children eat the right kind of food, talking to children in the mother tongue 
to improve their vocabulary, narrating traditional stories with good values or local history.  
The relationship and engagement between the child and the family during the early years is one 
of the most powerful predictors of a child’s development. Families are children’s first teachers - 
the quality of parent-child relationships and interactions can influence children’s learning and 
development deeply in the early years.
School and classroom processes in the early years must take this critical factor into account. 
Schools, family, and community are partners in the child’s development and learning.
Children at this Stage learn through play which includes a wide range of activities and stimulat-
ing experiences. All these activities and experiences need to be organized in a manner that chil-
dren remain engaged along with being emotionally and mentally motivated to learn. 
Within this broad idea of play, it must be noted that children also learn by observing, doing, lis-
tening, reading, speaking, writing, thinking, and practicing. They learn new concepts, interpret 
them, and connect this newly introduced knowledge with their existing knowledge. Explicit and 
systematic teaching, some practice and application is necessary especially once children begin 
literacy and mathematics. However, all of this, must adhere to the basic requirement of children’s 
positive engagement with strong elements of fun and play.

Section 1.5 
Curricular Goals of the Foundational Stage
The Foundational Stage is for children between the ages of 3 to 8 years. There has been a long 
tradition of inquiry both in India and other cultures on the various domains of development that 
have been observed in young children that are both natural and desirable. 
There has been a long tradition of inquiry both in India and other cultures on the various do-
mains of development that have been observed in young children that are both natural and de-
sirable. The Panchakosha concept in the Taittiriya Upanishad is one of the earliest articulations 
of the different domains of development of the human being. These descriptions remain relevant 
along with the more modern understanding that has emerged through Developmental Biology, 
Psy chology and Cognitive Neurosciences.
Physical Development, or annamaya kosha and pranamaya kosha understood together, in-
cludes bodily awareness and embodied learning through active engagement of all sensorial per-
ceptions. Emotional and spiritual development or the manomaya kosha involves becoming aware 
of and skilfully regulating our emotions. 
The domain of Socio-emotional and Ethical Development, thus emerges as an important do-
main of development both from the Indian traditions and current research. The development of 
the intellect, or vijnanamaya kosha, is emphasised to engage meaningfully with the cognitive and 
conscious aspects of human experience. 
The domain of Cognitive Development captures this aspect of development. Anandamaya ko-
sha, or experience of transcendence, is best addressed for this age group through arts and cul-
ture. Thus, including the domain of Aesthetic and Cultural Development, makes the educa-
tional experience holistic and complete. NEP 2020 has emphasised on Foundational Literacy and 
Numeracy as an ‘urgent and necessary prerequisite to learning.’ 
This emphasis has been realised by giving special attention to Foundational Literacy through the 
domain of Language and Literacy Development and Foundational Numeracy through the 
domain of Cognitive Development. Finally, the Foundational Stage is also seen as setting the 
foundations for formal schooling. The development of Positive Learning Habits that are more 
appropriate for formal school environments becomes another important Curricular Goal for this 
Stage. Thus, the Curricular Goals for the Foundational Stage have been derived by giving equal 
consideration to the vision and details of NEP 2020, and the domains of development.

Section 1.8 
Pedagogy
A safe, secure, comfortable, and happy classroom environment can help children learn better 
and achieve more at the Foundational Stage. Care and responsiveness with ample opportunities 
to experience, experiment and explore are the hallmark of pedagogy at this Stage.
1.8.1 Building a Positive Relationship between Teachers  
 
  
and Children 
When we walk into our classrooms, we see the wide-eyed children who are bright, quick to ob-
serve and interested in everything around them. They constantly ask questions. Sometimes they 
can quietly observe something for a long time. At other times, they lose interest in a matter of 
minutes. Sometimes they need to jump and move around. At other times, they enjoy a quiet story. 
Sometimes they cry and clamour to go home. At the same time, they like to be comforted and 
cajoled and are willing to be convinced to stay back! They can be curious and considerate, de-
lightful, and determined, affectionate, and adventurous, funny, and fearless.
At this Stage, for many children, it could also be their first experience of spending several hours 
away from their homes. Children require tenderness, nurturing and love. Working with them, 
being with them, caring for them means enjoying all the very different personalities that they 
are. Teachers need to be warm and genuine, patient and calm, understanding and empathetic, we 
need to give our children unhurried time and attention.
Children must feel that they belong, they can trust, they must feel free to try out and explore and, 
therefore, learn better. 
It is our job as Teachers to ensure that children settle and enjoy their time at school. A safe, pos-
itive relationship between Teacher and child is enriching both for emotional and cognitive devel-
opment. To build such a relationship teachers should get to each child individually, listen to the 
children, observe them, recognise, and respond to the moods of the children, and visit their 
homes regularly. 
1.8.2 Learning through Play- Conversation, Stories, Toys,  
  
Music, Art, and Craft
Classrooms for young children are vibrant and full of life. Children enjoy learning through sever-
al ways - talking, listening, using toys, working with material, painting, and drawing, singing, 
dancing, running, and jumping. As Teachers, we use all these ways to work with our children.
123
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part B
1.8.2.1 
Conversations
Language is the medium through which children talk to themselves and to others, and it is with 
words that they begin to construct and get a grip on their reality. The ability to understand and 
use language clearly and cogently is essential for learning.
Conversations are very important for children’s ability to connect with people and things around 
them. Continuous conversations with children in the classroom help to build relationships of 
trust. 
Teachers can engage with children through free conversations where children can sit with the 
teachers and discuss on any interesting things that have occurred throughout the day on their 
way to school or anything they wish to share. In structured conversation the teacher can plan 
and organise a session in the morning hour where they talk and think through a topic together. 
Topics are often about children’s daily life events and happenings, and their feelings, they can be 
guided also. In villages most families have livestock, and the children are familiar with animals 
like dogs, goats, pigs, ducks. Teachers can have flash cards and small videos to show the children 
and have a conversation around it. 
1.8.2.2 
Storytelling
Stories are a particularly good medium for learning about social relationships, ethical choices, 
for understanding and experiencing emotions, and becoming aware of life skills. While listening 
to stories, children learn new words thus expanding their vocabulary, and learn sentence struc-
ture and problem-solving skills. Children with very short attention span concentrate for a longer 
time while engrossed in a story. Through culturally contextual stories, we can acquaint children 
with their culture, social norms and create awareness about their surroundings.
Reading aloud stories helps children realize that formal written language is a little different from 
the spoken language. Teachers can use books like picture books, story books with or without 
pictures, or story books in multiple languages. Flash cards that have story scenes drawn or print-
ed on them can also be used to tell stories.
Besides listening to stories, children must also have the opportunity to tell stories. Stories told by 
children can be the same ones they have heard or something they have created. The Teacher can 
begin to tell a story and ask children to complete it.
1.8.2.3 
Toy-Based Learning
This is an important sub-set of play-based pedagogy. Young children learn from first-hand expe-
riences and working with actual objects. They try out and explore and learn. The classroom en-
vironment should cultivate this spirit of exploration through playing with toys and manipula-
tives. 
Many local toys are available in every child’s surroundings. These should be used as important 
resources for teaching and learning. Whether a toy is simple or complex, it has a lesson for the 
child to learn. When a child holds a toy, and manipulates it, she is practicing her motor skills and 
strengthening her hand-eye coordination.
124
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part B
When a child builds a tower with blocks and eventually watches it fall to the ground, she learns 
concepts and thinks about a solution to stop this fall. A puzzle helps a child explore patterns. 
When children use blocks, dolls, animal toys, balls, mini-cars, or pretend toys, they start creating 
stories and living out scenarios in their minds. Board games teach children to follow simple rules 
and enhance understanding of language and mathematics.
Toys can also be made from readily available items such as fabric, bottles, cardboard boxes, yarn, 
cooking pans, bangles, pipe cleaners and pinecones.  Traditionally they toy that are used are Ring 
Set Puzzle, Dhingli (Cotton Dolls), Kitchen set, etc.
NCERT’s handbook on Toy-Based Pedagogy is an excellent guide for this.
1.8.2.4 
Songs and Rhymes
Children love singing songs and rhymes, and dancing to music. Songs are also a wonderful means 
of learning language. Children understand different concepts through songs and their vocabu-
lary also expands. Physical movements accompanying the songs enhance gross and fine motor 
movements, and body movements and gestures help children in understanding concepts. Songs 
promote interaction among children and lead to cooperation.
Local context specific songs and rhymes (e.g., Pancharakunju in Malayalam, ghum parani mashi 
pishi in Bangla, machili jal ki rani hai in Hindi, aane banta in Kannada) are another good way to 
increase vocabulary, imagination, and expression in different kinds of songs. Songs of different 
languages provide children an ability to infer, make connections between common and different 
words in a language. Most of us in India are multilingual, and it is important that the songs and 
rhymes promote children’s ability to remain multilingual.
The Teacher could select a few rhymes or songs in two or three local languages, practice them 
and sing with children. Grandparents, parents, and community members can be wonderful re-
sources for this. 
1.8.2.5 
Music and Movement
Music is joy. Children grow up listening to lullabies and the humming of their grandmothers. 
There are so many sources of music around us - farmers singing in the field, buzzing of the bees, 
cooing of the koyal or rain pattering on a window. 
Music is also a strong stimulation for brain development and formation of synaptic connections. 
So, following rhythm and playing simple musical instruments, and singing should be encour-
aged. Body movements can accompany claps or rhythm played on a tin box or a khanjari (tam-
bourine) or manjira (cymbals).
Music and movement activities can also be done in different ways. Children could quietly listen 
to instrumental music or dance freely to rhythm or make body movements accompanied by 
rhythm. A range of instruments, which are either local, homemade, or purchased, should be 
made available to children for first-hand experiences in sound exploration and music-making.
Teachers could include a variety of music, dances, sound sources, rhymes, chants, and songs with 
different moods, contexts, and languages for children to listen to and perform in the classrooms.
Dancing, singing, rhymes, folk songs, action songs and finger plays provide opportunities for 
children to learn musical concepts.
125
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part B
1.8.2.6 
Art and Craft 
Children enjoy playing with colours and creating something that is of interest to them. Art and 
craft provide another medium for children to express their ideas, emotions, and feelings.
Teachers can encourage children to draw using paper and crayons, sketch pens, coloured or 
black pencils or charcoal. Children can also draw on slates, blackboards, or floors, every corner 
of the classroom can be utilised. Similarly painting, pasting, clay-moulding are great ways to en-
gage children, however teachers should make them open-ended, with minimal direction from 
the teacher. 
Notions of ‘right’ and ‘wrong’, ‘good’ and ‘bad’ in terms of artistic expression must be avoided. 
Instead, different viewpoints, experiences, expression, and imagination are encouraged and cel-
ebrated. Within each arts discipline too, children need to be encouraged to discover their own 
methods and techniques of using instruments and materials, in addition to conventionally ac-
cepted methods. Children not only need to observe their surroundings visually, but also become 
keen observers of their own thoughts, feelings, emotions, expressions, actions, and overall be-
haviour. The Teacher should ensure that the arts classroom is always an inclusive environment.
1.8.2.7 
Indoor Games 
Just as exercising the body is important to keep it fit and healthy, so too is exercising the mind.
Games of strategy, logic and word puzzles, and recreational mathematics are the best way to ex-
cite children about mathematics, and to develop the logical skills that are so critical throughout 
their school years and indeed throughout life.
Jigsaw puzzles, playing with blocks, and solving mazes help to develop a child’s spatial reason-
ing. Different games of strategy (e.g., tic-tac-toe, and leading up to deeper games like chess) de-
velop strategic thinking and problem-solving skills. 
Playing games (e.g., Chaupad, Snakes and Ladders, Ludo) is fun - it also teaches counting, strategy, 
collaboration, healthy competition, bonding with peers. Word and logic puzzles are another fun 
way to teach deductive reasoning. Simple puzzles such as those in the box above help develop in 
children’s skills of logical and creative thinking in an enjoyable manner. The puzzles can get more 
challenging, and incorporate arithmetic and other elements, as children get older. Arithmetic 
puzzles and games can help develop a comfort with numbers and develop quantitative reason-
ing.
Making learning enjoyable through fun exercises, games, and puzzles can be a key aspect in en-
suring that children stay engaged and at the same time develop mental capacity and creativity. 
1.8.2.8 
Outdoor Games 
Children in the early years cannot sit in one place for a long period of time - they need to move 
around. Playing outside gives them a chance to explore the natural environment, test their phys-
ical limits, express themselves and build self-confidence. Most importantly, it helps to build gross 
motor skills, physical fitness, and balance.  
Children enjoy the space, the freedom to run and jump and climb and kick and fall. Playing out-
side also helps many children to relax and calm down. And it is a lot of fun! 
126
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part B
1.8.2.9 
Spending Time in Nature  
Children are naturally curious and need opportunities to explore, experiment, manipulate, cre-
ate, and learn about the world around them. Children start exploring their environment through 
their senses by scanning their environment, touching, holding, and handling whatever they see, 
listening and responding to sounds, music, and rhythm, and getting excited by unusual noises. 
Children’s thinking evolves as they construct an understanding of people, objects, and real-life 
situations through first-hand experiences. Children bring their own ideas, interests, and beliefs 
based on their own experiences and contexts as well as their own abilities.  
When Teachers and families provide opportunities to children to explore the world around them, 
experiment and discover, compare, ask questions, make close observations, think, and talk about 
their observations and predictions, they are being helped to satisfy their curiosities and make 
more discoveries. Sustaining children’s natural curiosity to explore the world through first-hand 
experiences at home and in the school lays the foundation for learning. 
Spending time with plants and trees and birds and animals or just being quiet around nature can 
develop the basis for Lifestyle for Environment (LiFE).
1.8.2.10 Field Trips
The local vegetable market could be an equally exciting place full of new sights and sounds! The 
doctor’s clinic, bus depot, post office and police station could all introduce children to an unfa-
miliar but interesting world, teaching them many new things. 
Small, local field trips as part of the learning process reinforce the knowledge the children have 
gained in the classroom and push them to ask more questions and build further connections 
with things that they already know. Children also learn to manage themselves and learn to be 
with others through these experiences.
1.8.2.11 Strategies for Literacy and Numeracy
A significant component of structured learning should be added for literacy and numeracy espe-
cially for Grades 1 and 2. 
a.  Classroom Strategies for Literacy
The teaching of language and literacy should provide children with ample opportunities to 
explore themselves as readers and writers, along with providing a balance of learning ‘low-
er-order’ skills (e.g., phonological awareness, decoding, writing letters and words correctly) 
and ‘higher-order’ skills (e.g., oral language development, engaging with books, drawing, and 
original writing) which are meaning-focused.
There are four major components in language and literacy instruction - oral language, word 
recognition, reading, and writing. While activities for the four blocks may be implemented in 
an integrated manner, it is important that children spend time working on each of the blocks 
on a regular basis.

Mathematics learning goals can be categorised into higher goals such as mathematization of 
a child’s thought processes (e.g., ability to handle abstract thinking, problem-solving, visuali-
sation, representation, reasoning, and making connections of mathematics concepts with 
other domains) and content-specific goals (those related to different concepts in mathemat-
ics (e.g., understanding numbers, shapes, patterns). Various age-appropriate approaches 
have been recommended to enable this in the Foundation Stage. 
To become mathematically proficient, children also need to build conceptual understanding, 
procedural understanding, strategies competence/application, communication and reason-
ing, and a positive attitude towards mathematics. 
All these strands of mathematical proficiency can be designed in the following four blocks for 
the daily classroom process. A mathematical approach/process must be the basis of and 
based on the nature of the task

Organising and creating a positive learning environment is important for a child’s develop-
ment and learning. The physical as well as psychological environment (safe, secure, comfort-
able, and happy) helps children to learn better and achieve more. Creating classroom norms 
with children, understanding why children behave inappropriately and managing this in a 
suitable way, disciplining focused on responsibility for action and self-control, language used 
by the teacher etc are important factors in creating a positive learning environment. Physical 
dimensions like flexible seating arrangements, displays and print-rich environments, colour-
ful and vibrant learning corners etc support children’s learning.

Section 1.9 
Creating a Positive Classroom Environment
As children enter school, their worlds expand, they make friends, begin connecting with adults 
beyond the family, and become more and more mobile and verbal. They want to explore and 
learn about everything. The role of the Teacher is very important in guiding children in their 
behaviour and in forming strong positive relationships.
Teachers, therefore, have to be thoughtful and responsive to the needs of children. Caring for 
children is complex and important work. It is complex because there are many parts involved in 
establishing relationships with children and their families. Enforcing norms should be done in a 
positive manner. 
A safe, secure, comfortable, and happy classroom environment can help children to learn better. 
It is important that the necessary facilities such as learning materials, equipment, and space for 
doing activities, working together, and playing so as to help each child learn better are available. 
Care is central to the classroom environment at the Foundational Stage - an attitude of concern 
and responsibility for children and relationships.  The classroom must be an inclusive, enabling 
learning environment that provides every child freedom, openness, acceptance, meaningfulness, 
belonging and challenge.
1.9.1 Managing Difficult Behaviour
Teachers will also have to learn to manage difficult behaviours as behaviour is often the unspo-
ken language through which children act out feelings and thoughts. It is also because they are 
unaware of behaviour norms or alternative ways of behaving. 
Teachers should help children settle and guide their behaviour positively. Positive guidance is 
crucial because they promote children’s self-control, teach children responsibility, and help chil-
dren make thoughtful choices. Caring and respectful adults create a supportive atmosphere to 
help young children explore alternative behaviours, develop social skills, and learn to solve prob-
lems. This is called a positive approach to guidance. An effective guidance approach is interac-
tive. Adults and children both learn to change as they interact with one another toward a com-
mon goal. 
Understanding the development of a child will help us set appropriate standards of behaviour/ 
expectations from children, think of appropriate alternatives, as well as age-appropriate expla-
nations or ways to explain to the child. 
Actions that insult or belittle are likely to cause children to view their teachers, parents and oth-
er caregivers negatively, which can inhibit learning and can teach the child to be unkind to oth-
ers. However, actions that acknowledge the child’s efforts and progress, no matter how slow or 
small, are likely to encourage healthy development.
130
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Part B
Discipline is a part of the guidance strategies adults use to help children become responsible for 
their actions, learn self-control, and behave appropriately. Discipline does not mean punishing 
and preventing behaviours.
One of the major goals of a good guidance process is to help children achieve self-discipline. This 
happens only if adults lead in ways that support children’s developing ability to control them-
selves. By gradually handing over to children the opportunity to govern their actions, adults 
communicate trust.
1.9.2 Language Used by Teacher 
As Teachers gain experience in handling problem behaviours, they learn to use the right kind of 
language. Teachers discover how potent the voice can be and what words will work best and 
when. They become aware of facial expressions and what a touch or a look will convey to chil-
dren.
How they use their body reflects a distinct attitude and approach to discipline. Through experi-
ence, new Teachers learn how to use these tools in ways that will work best for them and the 
children. Teachers should talk to children in the same way they talk to other people. Learn to 
control the volume and use good speech patterns for children to imitate. To be heard, get close 
enough to speak in a normal tone; get down to the child’s physical level. Often, lowering volume 
and pitch is effective. Use simple, clear statements, spoken once, will have more impact. The child 
will be able to focus on the real issues involved. When working with small children, the Teacher 
must be aware of body height and position and get down to the level of the child. The way Teach-
ers use their body invites or rejects close relationships and familiarity. A child will find Teachers 
more approachable if they are seated low, with arms available, rather than standing, with arms 
folded. 
The Teacher has to examine the way she was disciplined and acknowledge her experiences and 
feelings about it, particularly assumptions she may have on how children be- have depending on 
their context and background. 
Through experience, new Teachers will learn how to use these tools in ways that will work best 
for them and the children. The most effective methods of guidance are clear, consistent, and fair 
rules that are enforced in consistent, humane ways. Children should be aware of the consequenc-
es if the rules are broken. Good guidance practices emphasize the positive aspects of a child’s 
behaviour, not just problem behaviours. Guidance measures have greater meaning to children if 
they are encouraged to take responsibility for their actions and are part of the problem-solving 
process.

Section 1.10 
Choosing, Organising and Contextualising 
Content for Teaching 
Teachers at the Foundational Stage must be informed by the curricular goals, competencies and 
learning outcomes. The syllabus must contextualise the learning outcomes, guide teachers 
through handbooks on the sequence of learning planned in the syllabus, and also provide broad 
guidelines for assessments. The content should be derived from children’s life experiences and 
reflect the cultural, geographical, and social context in which the child is developing and grow-
ing, move from familiar to unfamiliar, simple to complex, and from self to others, and accommo-
date the diverse interests of children. 
1.10.1 Teaching-Learning Materials 
Teaching Learning Materials at this stage are for engaging children in multi-sensorial activities 
and actively use their hands; simple toys to manipulatives for counting and numeracy, children’s 
books, picture books, activity books, worksheets, audio-visual materials etc support learning. 
Textbooks should be designed specifically to achieve the Competencies as articulated for the 
Foundational Stage. Textbook developers should have sound knowledge of applied linguistics 
and mathematics, a clear understanding of the pedagogy that is appropriate for the competency 
and content, and also be aware of the current technology and audio-visual materials available for 
enhancing the learning experience of children. Local context and environment are also import-
ant considerations. If practicable, a teacher manual can be developed as a companion to the 
textbook, aligned to both its approach and content. 
a. Children at the Foundational Stage need to engage with texts in a variety of forms (e.g., 
picture books, storybooks, graded readers, and worksheets). A wide variety of books that 
are appropriate for all children including 3-year-olds should be made available to schools. 
Large picture books, colourful graded readers, books with engaging stories and poems, all 
these would make reading books an exciting and engaging experience for children. Our 
country has a rich heritage of stories, folklores and legends that vary from region to region. 
These stories need to be translated into all languages and good children’s literature can be 
produced from these sources and be made available to all. By making a variety of books 
available in schools, a sense and taste of sahitya can be encouraged in young minds.

Language Education
Languages are at the centre of human cognitive, social, and cultural experience. Language serves 
many simple and complex functions. It gives individuals the capacity to comprehend, analyse, 
and to relate to their own self and the world. It mediates knowledge acquisition as well as pro-
duction. Language enables effective communication, which is integral to formation and function-
ing of societies, of culture and of identity. 
Thus, issues related to language are some of the most fundamental in education and the effects 
of language learning are beyond language in themselves. 
The NCF gives central importance to language learning, across all stages, from Foundational to 
Secondary. It is guided by the commitment to multilingualism in NEP 2020 [NEP 2020 4.11-4.22]. 
134

Section 2.1 
Aims
Language education is critical for the development of the individual and so for the society. Know-
ing languages enable students to access the understanding, knowledge, and skills available in 
written or spoken forms in society. It develops their ability to express ideas and feelings, to be 
creative, to think rationally, to make well-informed choices, and act on those choices. 
Proficiency in languages is essential for a democratic society in which individuals participate and 
contribute to its political, economic, social, and cultural life. Proficiency in multiple languages 
including regional and home languages promotes a society which respects and appreciates one’s 
own as well as others’ culture. Such multilingualism also has direct benefits for the individual in 
terms of cognitive development and flexibility.  
Language learning in schools must specifically aim to achieve the following:
a. Achieving literacy: Literacy is fundamental to school education. Students attaining the 
knowledge of grammatical structure and vocabulary of a language and applying these skills 
and understanding to daily life is an important achievement. Achieving literacy means all 
students demonstrating fluent and critical reading, writing, and comprehension capacities 
in the language.    
b. Developing effective communication skills and other functional abilities: Students will 
develop their language capacities to think critically, identify real-world problems, analyse 
them, make rational arguments, and work out solutions. Learning a language well, means 
using language to think and communicate effectively in a variety of situations, and to be able 
to make sense of concepts to build an understanding of the world.
c. Building literary and creative capacities: Language teaching in schools must aim at 
building capacities in students towards an appreciation of the aesthetic aspects of language 
and allow for an exploration of how to be creative and imaginative in their spoken and 
written expressions. Language serves as the vehicle for aesthetic and creative expression in 
cultures. 
d. Building multilingual capacities: The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 explicitly 
guides language development in schools to focus on teaching many languages and 
developing multilingual capacities. It says, “As ... multilingualism has great cognitive benefits 
to young students, children will be exposed to different languages early on (but with a 
particular emphasis on the mother tongue), starting from the Foundational Stage onwards...” 
[NEP 2020, 4.12]
e. Appreciation of linguistic diversity: Given the wide range of languages and the richness of 
their cultures in India, students must be taught to understand and appreciate diversity in 
linguistic cultures and identities through samples of various kinds of literature from 
languages across the subcontinent.
136

National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Section 2.2 
 Nature of Knowledge
In its most basic function, language is a system of the use of words and sentences used in the 
form of speaking, writing, or gestures for communication among human beings.  
a. Language is a rule-governed system. The spoken and written components of language are 
governed by rules that are often a set of conventions or practices. The learning of relevant 
sounds, shapes, words, sentence structures, and grammar rules, and an understanding of the 
functional and situational aspects of language use requires understanding and engagement 
with these rules. 
b. Language is an integral part of a culture and a marker of cultural identity. Language 
does not operate in isolation and is related to social interaction, context, and culture. Lan-
guage development among students is the act of cultural development; it invariably requires 
learning about its culture and society.  
c. Language evolves constantly, there is no ‘pure’ and static language. Many languages 
learn from other languages and contexts and evolves over time. No language can be treated 
as intrinsically pure and superior. Learning any language would mean being able to appreci-
ate and engage with such evolution.
d. Language(s) cannot be distinguished from dialect(s) with any universally accepted 
criterion. Such distinctions are usually based on political, social, and cultural factors. In this 
NCF we use only the word ‘language’, which would denote all variants of the language, 
without affixing any particular variant as ‘the language’ and the rest as ‘dialects’.  
Such specific characteristics of languages in addition to other aspects like its aims (described 
earlier) and how children learn languages (described later in this chapter), guides the 
framing of the curriculum for language and its teaching.

Section 2.3 
Current Challenges
Language learning in schools is currently facing a few challenges which need urgent addressing. 
a. Low levels of literacy: India is currently in a crisis of learning where a large proportion of 
students currently in elementary school have not attained foundational skills in literacy, i.e., 
the ability to read and comprehend basic text.
b. Insufficient time allocated to language learning: The amount of time allotted to language 
learning in a week’s timetable in too many schools is inadequate to meet the current literacy 
crisis, let alone achieve the further aims of language. 
c. Low-quality learning materials: The learning materials used for language teaching across 
the stages are currently of uneven quality, with a lot of it being of low quality. Good quality 
materials need careful selection of relevant content (words, context, illustrations, layout) 
that is age-appropriate and interesting for students to learn from. 
d. Inadequate levels of teacher preparation: Too often an assumption is made that that 
anyone can teach language to students without adequate training in the subject and/or with-
out adequate time for preparation. This contributes underachievement in language learning 
and the classes becoming boring. The NEP acknowledges that “There has been a severe 
scarcity of skilled language teachers in India, despite various measures being taken. Lan-
guage-teaching too must be improved to be more experiential and to focus on the ability to 
converse and interact in each language and not just on the literature, vocabulary, and gram-
mar of the language. Languages must be used more extensively for conversation and for 
teaching-learning.”  [NEP 2020, 22.7] Teachers with appropriate training, flair, and practice in 
the subject are essential for a meaningful and enjoyable student experience in language 
learning. 
e. Ineffective pedagogic strategies: Many often used teaching practices are not based on a 
sound understanding of how languages work and how students learn languages across 
various age groups. Teachers need to take stock of the strategies they have been using till 
now for their enjoyability and effectiveness.
f. Content-completion-focused rather than competency-focused teaching: Like other 
subjects, language classrooms have become a place for mechanically going through the steps 
in activities or in a textbook. Effective language teaching must be driven by achievement of 
competencies and outcomes in students rather than a focus to merely finish the content 
given in textbook.  
g. Memory-based assessment: Language learning intended to accomplish language proficien-
cy, communication and functional ability and appreciation of literature. But most of the 
assessment focus on assessing memory of the content given in text book rather than assess-
ing language abilities. 
138

Section 2.4 
Learning Standards
As mentioned earlier, the approach to language teaching and learning in schools, including the 
learning standards to be achieved, is guided by the three-language formula committed in the 
NEP 2020.
Box B-2.4-i 
Learning three languages
Students will learn at least three languages in their school years, denoted R1, R2, and R3 in 
this document.
R1: This is the language used as medium of instruction (MoI), and in which literacy is first 
attained. Preferably it should be the most familiar language of the students, which is usually 
the mother tongue/home language. With India’s linguistic diversity, even within a class-
room, it may not be possible to have the home language as the R1 for all students; in such 
circumstances a language which is familiar to the students should be chosen as R1 -- which 
is often the most commonly used local language. 
R2: This could be any other language, including English. 
R3: This is any other language that is not R1 or R2.
The state or the relevant bodies need to decide upon R1, R2, or R3.
“All efforts will be made early on to ensure that any gaps that exist between the language 
spoken by the child and the medium of teaching are bridged. In cases where home lan-
guage/mother tongue textbook material is not available, the language of transaction 
between teachers and students will still remain the home language/mother tongue wherev-
er possible….” [NEP 2020, 4.11].
The approach to literacy in R1 is taken up in detail in the chapter on the Foundational Stage 
– Chapter 3, section 3.2
The aim is to be an independent reader and writer in R1 by age 8 (Grade 3). A student will 
demonstrate similar level of literacy in R2 by age 11 (Grade 6), and in R3 by age 14 (Grade 9). 
Schools will develop in students the capacity for basic communication for social purposes and 
linguistic proficiency for academic use in the classrooms in R1 and R2, and only the capacity for 
basic communication for social purposes in R3.
This section lays out the Curricular Goals, Competencies, and a few illustrative Learning Out-
comes for R1, R2, and R3 for Preparatory, Middle, and Secondary Stages.

Principles of Content Selection
It is important to choose content that is appropriate and relevant to the developmental stages of 
language learning in students. Inadequate, age-inappropriate, and low-quality materials are tak-
ing away the value and joy in language classrooms. Teachers must ensure the use of good quality 
teaching-learning materials, carefully chosen and curated for students across all age groups. 
This will ensure enthusiasm for learning and foster a connection with the languages being 
learned.
2.5.1 For the Preparatory stage (R1 and R2):
a. For developing oracy: Learning materials that lend themselves to students to practice 
conversation with each other should be chosen.  Playful language activities remove the fear 
of language and induce the fun element into learning. Content should have a variety of 
activities like role plays, dramas, and interviews that allow students to practice these in the  
classroom.
b. For developing reading skills: Reading material should have variety, including stories, 
poems, plays, essays, diaries, comics, cartoons, letters, and travelogues. It should have a 
balance of familiar and unfamiliar text and context. Large font sizes, coloured pictures, and 
catchy titles of the chapters would arouse interest in the students. The text should be 
thought-provoking and generate imagination and interest among students. Content should 
lend itself to help students progress from guided reading to independent reading.
c. For developing writing skills: Chosen content must enable students to learn writing skills 
systematically and joyfully. The material must be designed to make students practice simple 
sentences on their own. Activities like the completion of stories, finding suitable titles for 
pictures, catchy headlines for incidents, poster making, and banners should be part of 
textbooks.
d. For developing values and dispositions: The content chosen should align with the larger 
purposes of education and values and dispositions that are embedded in NEP 2020 and 
Constitutional values. This means choosing content that includes authors from all walks of 
life, kinds of literature that represent local, regional, and linguistic diversity in languages, 
and explicit teaching of appreciation for the cultures of the subcontinent.
Teacher’s Voice B-2.5-i (To be edited)
A very short story
Choosing appropriate content is vital for teachers to meaningfully engage class 4 students 
in achieving the expected Learning Outcomes for that grade. 
Following is the one of the learning outcomes chosen for class 4 students. 
 
152
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Learning outcome: Comments independently on the main ideas with their own impressions 
of the themes, events, pictures, characters, and title of the text that was read out. 
To achieve this, I must choose a story that has many characters, a clear plot, and theme. 
Additionally, the following principles will help with the choice for class 4 to achieve the 
learning outcome mentioned above. 
Content selection principles: 
a. The text should be thought-provoking and generate imagination and interest among  
students.
b. The content chosen should align with the larger purposes of education and values and 
dispositions that are embedded in Curriculum and Constitutional values. In this case, the 
values are of empathy and concern for others. 
c. Learning materials that lend themselves for students to practice conversation with each 
other should be chosen.
Content: A very short story, A Happy Family
There was once a family that had very few things, but many joys. They had two buffaloes but 
no money for food. One morning, the man’s wife said, ‘We have two buffaloes and four 
mouths to feed. Let us sell one of the buffaloes.’ The man agreed and began his trip to the 
market.
The man came home that evening, looking hungry, sad, and tired. His wife and children ran 
up to him and asked, ‘What happened? What did you bring from the market?’
‘I sold the buffalo for a horse...’ the man began, when his children began to jump up and 
down. ‘A horse, a horse! We can ride it every day!’
‘No, the horse was blind. So, I exchanged it for a goat...’ the man continued, when his chil-
dren began to jump up and down. ‘A goat, a goat! We can drink milk every day!’
‘No, the goat was sick. So, I sold it for some money...’ the man added, when his children began 
to jump up and down. ‘Good! We can eat good food today!’
‘No, I gave the money to a beggar. He looked very hungry...’ the man finished. His wife and 
children came up to him and said, ‘It is alright. His hunger must have been bigger than ours. 
Come, let us eat now.’ So, the whole family sat down and ate ganji* like any other night.
* ganji – rice porridge in Kannada
The above story is appropriate for grade 4 as it is simple, familiar, interesting and has the 
scope for students to have thought provoking and imaginative conversations. It does not 
explicitly preach any value to students but allows for thinking about values, as it is embed-
ded with values of empathy and concern for others. Students can easily converse about the 
story and connect it to their real-life experiences. The story also gives space for students 
reflect and comment with their impressions and experiences on the characters, plots, and 
the title too while talking about the story. 
153
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
2.5.2 For the Middle and Secondary Stages (R1 & R2)
a. For developing functional language skills: Any learning material that is chosen must 
allow the learners to grow in the functional use of language. Here is a list of suggested 
content for this.
i. 
Choosing themes and topics that are familiar to students and impact their daily life, 
allowing them to participate in group discussions, debates, role plays etc. For example, 
traffic jams in cities, effective town planning, floods, drought, pollution, and so on.
ii. 
Letter writing, whether on paper or by email, is an important skill. Content must have 
samples of various kinds of letters, especially formal letters, including samples of letters 
for real-life situations like applying for a new course in a college, a scholarship, a loan in 
the bank, any application in a government office, police station, court, etc.
iii. Apart from this, a variety of content including notes, presentations, statements of 
purpose, and presentations; articles, features, news items, and reports; advertisements, 
posters, banners, headlines, videos, and scripts for social media should be used in 
language classrooms.
b. For developing literary skills: Students must be introduced to and given adequate 
exposure to different genres of literature. In the middle stage, introducing nonfiction and 
fiction would help students broaden there would help their critical reading and writing 
abilities.  In the secondary stage, students must be taught to enjoy the beauty of literature in 
greater depth and breadth. The selection of literature should be from regional, national, and 
global writers and varied genres. These can be relevant extracts that students can engage 
with close and critical reading. The content should also have a diversity of experiences from 
writers from all walks of life. For example, in Kannada literature, Vachanaganu, 
Janapadageete, Janapadakathe, and Lavani are good examples of this. In Tamil Literature, 
the Thirukkural, and in Assamese literature, stories like Koni Jun, and works of Krishan Kant 
Hantikar and Jyoti Prasad Agarwala.
c. For developing linguistic skills: The content should help with improving fluency and 
accuracy of the language. Linguistic aspects such as punctuation marks, use of gender, 
sentence structures, and tenses must be prominently identifiable in the material to enhance 
language proficiency in reading, speaking, and writing. Similarly, the selected content 
should allow students to practice advanced creative writing with greater sophistication 
using various literary devices and contexts.
d. For eliciting appreciation of linguistic heritage and diversity: Content should consider 
the multilingual aspect of the Indian subcontinent, making a place for local and regional 
dialects and language variations in the materials selected.  There should be a provision for 
neighbouring states’ literature to be read by students of each state in the Middle and 
Secondary Stages (E.g., In Kannada, works of Pampa, Ranna, Janna, and Keshiraja; in 
Assamese, the story Bir Lasit Phukari that talks about the freedom struggle of local 
Assamese people and the poetry of Shankardev who has written about the culture of 
Assamese people).
154
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
e. For art and sports integration in the learning of languages: Compositions in art and 
language can share some common aspects in aesthetics of form, style, and content. Using art 
to access ideas, to represent feelings and events along with descriptive writing would only 
enhance the connection to the learning and the expression of the students. Making posters, 
signs, and symbols, and illustrating for narrative and descriptive writing can lead to an 
interesting interdisciplinarity of approach in the understanding of language and expression 
(E.g., Utsara in Assamese textbooks talks about various festivals in the state of Assam and 
various dance and art forms linked to the festivals). Similarly, using games and activities in 
language classes as springboards to a conversation (and as energisers) can improve the 
experience of language learning significantly.
f. For developing values and dispositions: The content chosen should be aligned with the 
larger purposes of education and values and dispositions that are embedded in NEP 2020 
and Constitutional values. This means choosing content that includes authors from all walks 
of life, kinds of literature that represent local, regional, and linguistic diversity in languages, 
and explicit teaching of appreciation for the cultures of the subcontinent.    
Teacher’s Voice B-2.5-ii (To be edited)
Poem: to analyse a literary text
A curricular goal for secondary grades is for students to develop an appreciation of the 
aesthetics in different genres through analysis of style and content and employ these ele-
ments in their writing. One of the competencies being that the student analyses a literary 
text by close reading, critiquing form, and style, interpreting possible meanings.
In grade 9, towards this goal, I want my students to achieve the learning outcome: Infers 
and draws conclusions from the text, identifies different points of view in it, and interprets 
possible meanings.
The principles I keep in mind for selecting an appropriate content to achieve this learning 
outcome are:
a. Choose themes and topics that are familiar to students and impact their daily life, 
allowing them to participate in group discussions, debates, role plays etc.
b. Content should provide opportunity for the students to enjoy the beauty of literature in 
greater depth and breadth.
c. Linguistic aspects such as punctuation marks, use of gender, sentence structures, and 
tenses must be prominently identifiable in the material to enhance language proficiency 
in reading, speaking, and writing.
d. The selected content should allow students to practice advanced creative writing with 
greater sophistication using various literary devices and contexts.
155
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Keeping these in mind, I chose the following poem as content:
 ‘You said, I Agreed’ by Anita Nair
(From her book Malabar Mind)
You Said, I Agreed
Let us be friends, you said
Let us be friends, I agreed
Let there be nothing more, you said
Let there be nothing more, I agreed
I made no declaration, no promises, you said
You made no declaration, no promises, I agreed
It was a minor aberration, a detour, you said
It was a minor aberration, a detour, I agreed
It isn’t as if I did anything, you said
It isn’t as if anything happened, I agreed
We got out of it with dignity, you said
We got out of it with dignity, I agreed
The poem is suitable for high school students as it allows them to think hard for possible 
meanings in a piece of literary text. 
The subject of the poem is about a close relationship between two people. The literary 
element of ‘repetition’ is beautifully used in the poem. It is this ‘repetition’ that gives an 
opportunity for the students to interpret possible meanings of the text. Right from the title 
till the last word in the poem, the element of ‘repetition’ is used, and it serves multiple 
purpose. 
The title ‘you said, I agreed’ depicts stress on an important point ‘dominance of one partner 
over other’ which is crucial for high school students to note in understanding inequality in 
relationships. But there can be multiple views here on the type of relationships as it is not 
clear whether it is between male and female or female and female or male and male.
Since the whole poem has repetition of the title in almost each stanza, it creates an impact 
on the readers and persuades them to think deeply about what is happening in the situa-
tion. Again, there can be multiple views on the theme here. Some may argue it is about 
power struggle, some may call it conflict, some may refer to it as complexity of human 
relationships. The text offers huge scope for the students to interpret poem differently and 
brings multiple point of views by close reading of the text. 
Lastly the ‘repetition’ also brings a rhythm in the poetry making it like song but again offers 
multiple ways to recite/sing it. The selection of the words (dignity, aberration) and sentence 
structures (repetition in all lines except few words that are not changed) can be analysed by 
each student in the class differently based on his or her previous experience and connecting 
it with the poet’s actual intention of writing this poem.

National Curriculum Framework for School Education
2.5.3 For R3 (Middle Stage)
For learning R3, the chosen content should have materials such as letter charts and sentence 
cards that introduce the basic script.
a. For reading and writing development in R3, the book should contain small stories and 
poems of that language as we use in the Preparatory Stage level. 
b. Reading and writing materials of R3 should be organized from simple to complex levels of 
learning, they should have some basic introduction to simple literature in R3. 
c. The chosen content must lend itself to oral presentations and conversations like continuing 
a story, completing a conversation and so on. 
d. Content should enable the learning of functional skills in the language of R3 like basic letter 
writing, day-to-day conversations, poster making, invitations etc.
Box B-2.5-i
Teaching print and digital reading skills: Future ‘biliteracy’
One important thing to consider given the nature of the current social milieu and what is to 
likely come is the daily presence of digital media and screen-based devices in the lives of 
students. Reading and writing on smartphones and computers are the rising norms among 
people from different walks of life. Given this, it is the need of the hour to teach students to 
be ‘biliterate’ in their reading skills. This will not only save them from the ‘shallow reading’ 
that digital media seems to foster, but also maximize the benefits of digital media in their 
learning.  Contemporary research suggests the value of ‘deep reading’ in the lives of human 
beings and while well-meaning adults still struggle to switch between printed text and 
screens, students could be taught to read each medium and switch easily between the two 
(much like switching between two languages) without compromising on focused attention, 
the pace of reading, and good meaning-making. This would mean a planned and deliberate 
teaching for students on how to read digital media, instead of treating the two mediums as 
the same. 
Students need to develop a deep reading circuit in the first place, before being flooded with 
the distractions that are common to digital media. So, students spending their early years 
immersed in printed material and then being introduced to digital reading with teacher 
guidance may be a way forward in this realm.

While all children have an innate and natural capacity to learn languages, it is necessary to know 
how language is learned best by students in the educational context of a school. This will inform 
effective pedagogic strategies in each stage. 
a. Language learning must be a deliberative process in schools: ‘Language learning’ is a 
formal education method where a language is deliberatively taught through direct 
instructions and essential rules. This is a conscious process unlike ‘language acquisition’ in 
early life when a language is absorbed subconsciously. Reading and writing in languages 
involve an active teaching-learning process as they are not natural or intuitive skills. 
Students learn the letter/symbol and sound association, letters forming words which are 
ascribed meaning, and words forming sentences to convey thoughts. They learn rules of 
language related to the position of the words in a sentence, and varying intonations can 
change the meaning of the word and sentence. A word can have different meanings 
depending on the context and usage. Students practice these rules and apply them to 
communicate in different forms of speaking and writing.  
b. A strong base in literacy is crucial for good language learning later: Early literacy sets 
the base for children to learn reading and writing well. Expanding vocabulary through 
stories and rhymes, exposure to picture-text books and a print-rich class experience, 
playing with sounds and reading aloud picture books help children acquire early literacy in 
their Foundational Stage. Research shows that children’s phonemic (sound structure) 
awareness in the early years is strongly related to later reading achievement. Students in 
the Preparatory Stage would need such continued support and sustained practice to attain 
good levels of literacy. 
c. Students learn better from a balanced approach to literacy: Students become 
independent readers gradually when exposed to a balance of instructions for meaning 
making, and instructions for reading through decoding and spelling. Proficiency in literacy 
can be achieved by focusing on word recognition and accuracy and language comprehension 
and expression.  
d. Students read better with focused practice and repeated reading of familiar texts: 
Students’ reading expression, fluency, and comprehension improve when they read familiar 
texts. The practice of repeatedly reading short texts significantly enhances their confidence, 
fluency, and comprehension in reading.  This helps students self-correct and adjust their 
reading when they are unable to understand a new text material.  Making sense of each 
word, connecting its meaning with the previous and next word, seeing a sentence in a single 
sight, and grasping the meaning of the sentence is the beginning of comprehension in 
reading. Predicting the sentence that follows, or the paragraph that follows is a sign of 
students growing in their comprehension skills. 
e. Students grow in their overall language abilities from sustained exposure to a variety 
of literature: Exposure to a variety of literature and forms appropriate to a student’s grade 
level would create an interest in reading. Both language and library classes that allow 
students to explore books that they are interested in, give class time for reading, support 
student literacy, and provide a literature-rich experience develop in students an abiding 
interest in reading. Students will then graduate from ‘learning to read’ to the ‘reading to 
158

learn’ stage. By the Middle Stage students are developmentally ready with the capacity to 
analyse, synthesise, describe, narrate, and apply their language skills. In their Secondary 
Stage, students can recognise, think about, and express independent responses to social 
events and interactions. 
f. Students grow in their writing capacities through constant, integrated, guided 
practice: Integrating reading and writing in classroom instruction makes students develop 
the ability of purposive writing. Purpose gives direction to writing. Students use language 
better once they understand the context and the format of the activity. The practical and 
functional use of language in the middle school and high school years are formative in their 
enjoyment of language learning in later life. Exploring creative writing, interpretive, 
descriptive, and narrative writing further enhances their linguistic sensibilities.  
2.6.1 Strategies for the Preparatory Stage (R1 and R2)
a. Oral language development: 
A strong base in speaking skills has a significant influence on writing and reading abilities in 
the case of language learning. Listening to a variety of contexts, texts and literature would 
enhance the vocabulary which further leads to proficiency in speaking. Students must be en-
couraged to speak about their experiences and describe the texts that they listen to or read. 
They need to listen to teachers talking about books and reading out text from diverse genres. 
Similarly, students listen to/watch the news (radio/TV), movies, serials, educational chan-
nels with subtitles, and audio-video materials. They could be asked to respond, describe, nar-
rate, summarise, and do role play from what they listened to. Student interactions among 
themselves based on the activities mentioned above will be useful too. Activities such as sto-
rytelling and discussion, conversation on themes, and opportunities for students to talk and 
share their experiences through free and guided conversations enable oral language skills. 
b. Developing reading comprehension:
This is the stage where the beginnings of ‘reading-to-learn’ can happen. Teachers facilitate 
reading activities for developing the ability to understand different texts. The ability of com-
prehension encompasses multiple abilities such as making meaning of words, building con-
nections between the words, making meaning of the whole sentence, predicting the next sen-
tence, building connections of meaning between sentences, and grasping the main ideas of a 
paragraph/text through connecting their imagination and experiences. Through developing 
this ability, students get the pleasure of reading and continue to explore different genres of 
reading. 
Some classroom strategies to develop reading comprehension are students reading aloud, 
reading and talking, repeated reading for fluency, doing shared readings, guided readings, 
independent readings, relating readings to prior knowledge, and summarising. 
159

National Curriculum Framework for School Education
c. Developing writing skills
To improve writing skills, writing activities require persistent practice and deliberative focus 
in the classroom. Many times, writing is limited to copying a given text, copying answers to 
questions, and reproducing what is memorized. This does not help with the development of 
writing skills. Writing to express their understanding of the text, their views, and their opin-
ion, and independent writing need to be taught and practised. The ability to write requires 
organizing thoughts and presenting them in writing form to present to the audience. Writing 
is also essential for fulfilling many functional requirements in life. 
Writing skills can be taught effectively by reinforcing with lots of purposive speaking first, by 
exposing students to different samples of writing forms and styles, teaching them planning 
and drafting before writing a piece based on audience and purpose, and modelling good writ-
ing for them. Writing is also learned better when students are taught to write to communicate 
with a relatable purpose, encourage to write on varied themes, help them with guided writ-
ing, and finally allow to do independent writing. 
d. Vocabulary development: 
The richness of vocabulary determines students’ proficiency in comprehension and language 
use. Teaching writing, reading or speaking to communicate their ideas, and vocabulary should 
be part of daily instruction.  
Some useful strategies for developing vocabulary are helping students predict contextual 
meaning of words, engaging them in word games and word building activities, and teaching 
them to use a dictionary.

Developing interest and preference in reading
To create interest in books among children, it is necessary to give these students books to 
read. It would also be important to read books to students and discuss books with them. As 
a teacher of class 4, I keep doing such efforts for my students often. Because of this, I can see 
that some children are getting interested in reading books. 
Today I thought that I should read the book ‘Kali Aur Dhamin Saap’ by Zai Whitaker to the 
children. The book belongs to the school library.  The book is about Kali, a child of the 
snake-catchers of the Irula tribe in Tamil Nadu. The story depicts Kali’s isolation from 
school, lack of friendship with children as he comes from a marginalized section of society. 
He is also very clever in catching rat snakes which other children cannot do. 
Before narrating from the book, I sat the children down in a circle. I started talking to the 
children by showing the pictures of the book to the children. They were given chances to 
guess what the story might be about. 
First, the children were asked to read the name of the book. Some children read out its 
name. After this, we discussed about the writer and the illustrators.  Next, the children were 
asked, “Who is Kali?”.  The students said, “Kali is the name of the boy who is in the picture  
160
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
and Dhamin is the name of the snake.” Students further added, “From the picture it looks as 
if the snake and the boy would be friends.” Then the children were told that just like the 
Paniha snake which lives in the water, there is also the Dhamin snake, which is long, lives in 
the agriculture fields and eats rats.
Then further I talked to the children, “Looking at this picture, what will happen in the 
story?”.  Then, Sahiba spoke, “There will be a snake near the river. The boy will go there and 
make him his friend”. Then Muskan spoke, “The boy will go there, he will say to the snake 
that will you befriend me?”. Lucky then guessed, “Kali will be very poor. He will earn money 
by showing the snake to people”. Sammo quickly followed, “Kali will be sad”. And Tauseef was 
not far behind, “Kali will see a snake on the canal”, he declared. Similarly, few other children 
also expressed their guesses.
The conversation continued with students. I asked them by showing the next picture “How 
does Kali go to school?”. A few students said, “He looks sad. He might not want to go to 
school.” Here the children were able to capture the emotion depicted in picture. When I 
asked, “Why would he be sad?”, one of them said, “His mother must be telling him to go to 
school and he will not feel like going”.  Fiza was rather insistent, “His grandmother must 
have sent him to school”.  Another eagerly said, “He will be late for school, and he will be 
scolded in school.”
Then I read from book, “…he has no friends in school”. I asked the children “why wouldn’t he 
has any friends?”. They managed to say, “Because his father catches snakes, no one would 
make him a friend.” They were able to guess rather accurately indeed. From this, I was also 
getting to know that without reading, they identified the social discrimination with the help 
of experiences gathered from their own social interactions. Later, when the children saw the 
picture of a snake hanging on a stick in the picture, the story suddenly expanded in their 
imagination. The children started saying, “Kali catches the snakes and then he will become 
friends with the children in school.” After this, I continued reading on the next few pages and 
they were able to guess accurately what happened next by looking at the pictures.
The children liked the pictures of this book very much. Each student shared their favourite 
pictures from book like Kali catching the snake, putting it in the bag, the classmates clap-
ping for Kali, and getting ready to be his friend, the class teacher coming out from under the 
table, etc. At the end of the book, the children are happy looking at picture where many 
children who did not talk to him before finally agreed to be friends with Kali. 
I also understood during the discussion that Gulfam, a child in the class, found this story 
very relatable to him. Gulfam belongs to a family of performing arts and during the holidays 
he goes to perform at different places with his grandfather. His grandfather also keeps a 
snake with him and displays it too. During the conversation in the class, he tried to mention 
that earlier in the class, couple of his friends used to tease him by saying ‘Kalandar-Kaland-
ar’. It seems that students who teased him got reflected and felt bad about it.
After discussing about the book, the children in the class also discussed about their food 
habits.  In this conversation, Sammo and Gulfam kept their point, “whatever food that we all 
eat. we should not discriminate in the class”.
Then the children were asked which parts of the story they liked best. Children said, “When 
Kali caught the snake and the children clapped.” Couple of more questions related to how 
teacher scared, Kali’s friends acted earlier and later, etc. were asked and discussed with 
students.  
161
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
On completing the book, I showed them many story books from school library with diverse 
context and talked about how interesting those stories are. I also gently pushed them to 
choose the books which they want to read and asked them to borrow the books. It is clear 
that children have diverse interests while choosing books. A few wanted to explore other 
books in the library too. 
2.6.2 Strategies for the Middle Stage (R1 & R2) 
a. Critical listening and oral presentations: 
The focus in the Middle Stage of language learning is more on the functional and literary as-
pects, which will help students to use language formally. In this stage, students will progress 
to learning critical listening skills. Here listening to a variety of texts, contexts, and kinds of 
literature would enhance vocabulary, leading to proficiency in speaking, reading, and writing.  
Listening and speaking activities occur together. 
i. 
Panel discussions/debates: The teacher shows the students a sample discussion or 
conversation and asks the students to listen to the conversation carefully. The students 
identify the main theme, differentiate between facts and opinions, and recognise logical 
arguments. After each segment of the conversation, the teacher asks students to 
paraphrase the discussion. Students themselves can choose the and the teacher 
facilitates and moderates the gathering of information, helps with making notes, and 
preparing reports, and teaches how to compare viewpoints and present a convincing 
argument, how to paraphrase, and how to summarize. As a closure to such activities, 
students can reflect on their presentation and get a chance to correct themselves. They 
learn to rearticulate and conduct such events in the classroom.
ii. 
 Interviews:  After a mock interview without any preparation, the teacher elicits a 
discussion on the elements of an interview and how the interaction may be improved 
for clarity and purpose. Students also listen to different types of interviews like job 
interviews, and interviews with authors and famous personalities. This exposure will 
help the students prepare for their interviews. As the second step in the process, the 
teacher explains the structure of an interview and allows students to prepare and ask 
relevant questions for the interview. Finally, students begin to compile questions and 
publish responses. The class evaluates the interviews and their effectiveness.
iii. Anchoring and public speaking: Students are encouraged and supported to be 
anchors for school events, festivals, and school levels meetings. They learn to speak in 
public on topics like health and hygiene, school processes, and the importance of 
education. The teacher can help the students in choosing a topic, gathering information, 
practising, and handling questions from the audience.
iv. 
Reviews of movies, plays, and short films: As part of critical listening activities, the 
teacher can screen the movies and plays. A pre-viewing and a post-viewing talk about 
the movie/play and its significance can be discussed. Students also do a detailed review 
of movies/plays/short films that can be presented orally in the classroom.
162
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
b. Activities for developing reading skills:
This is the stage where ‘reading-to-learn’ would happen to a greater extent. Here, reading is not 
for just meaning-making but also to develop other higher-order skills of interpreting, analysing, 
and summarizing. Later, this will help the students to develop reading habits. 
i. 
 Developing functional reading skills: Teaching-learning materials for functional 
reading that are useful for their day-to-day life such as applications, letters, reports, 
invitations, emails, and essays should be chosen.  Students need to see different kinds of 
letters, posters, and circulars. They get the chance to recognize and understand the 
purpose of each of these with the teacher’s help. Additionally, some specific materials 
can be used where students learn to recognize the use of ambiguity, contradiction, 
paradox, irony, sarcasm, and understatement in the text. 
ii. 
Developing literary reading skills: In the Middle Stage, reading literature is one of the 
main components of language learning. Teachers can conduct a variety of literature-
related activities (E.g., choosing a genre for the week, or a theme for the week). In these 
activities, students learn to describe the effect of words used, identify basic literary 
devices, and share their overall experience of reading the text. 
iii. Developing critical reading skills: The teacher encourages independent student 
reading of a fiction or non-fiction text and gives space to discuss the intent of the author, 
understand the context, identify core content, and interpret possible meanings thus 
enabling critical reading.
c. Building students’ interest in reading:
It is necessary to build interest among students through engaging in exciting activities at school.  
These activities must be a part of the regular language classroom. For example, activities like 
‘book of the day’ (where extracts from a chosen book gets read in the class, and students discuss 
the plotline, characters, and themes in the book), ‘author of the day’ (where students read many 
works of the same author and discuss their style and broader concerns of the author), making a 
trip to the local library (to learn about book cataloguing, book search, and library maintenance), 
organising for a literature festival (filled with book talks, exhibitions, creative writing competi-
tions, have exhibits about authors from all walks of life), and a book exhibition (students display 
their current readings) would enhance student interest in books and reading.
d. Activities for developing writing skills:
i. 
Functional language writing skills: Students will learn some basic forms here.
1) Essays and reports: The teacher provide students with one or two samples of 
essays and reports pointing out how to identify the audience and purpose in each 
sample of the report and essay. The teacher then explains how to use a variety of 
planning strategies (including graphic organizers) to generate and organize ideas. As 
the second step in this process, the teacher asks the students to ideate and come up 
with ideas and organize their essays/reports. Students then move on to compose a 
few paragraphs with elaboration and continuity. The teacher explains how 
vocabulary and information enhance writing about an idea, and how tone and voice 
add to the style of writing.  Students must be encouraged to proofread and revise 
their writing for clarity of content, appropriateness of vocabulary, and relevance of 
information. 
163
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
2) Writing for the media (emails, blogs, comments, and posts): Students learn to 
construct appropriate messages for the media in the classroom and identify the 
attributes of media writing, namely, authorship, format, content, and purpose. While 
learning to write in this context, the teacher could provide samples of well-written 
blogs, emails, and comments.
ii. 
Literary language writing skills: 
1) Experiential writing: A book/situation may be done collaboratively selected by the 
teacher and the students. The teacher asks them to share their initial thoughts or 
experiences with others, which helps the children to articulate orally. This will bring 
further clarity to thoughts for the third step, which is, the teacher shares an example 
of well-known experiential writing and explains the nuances of the same. Finally, the 
teacher allows the children to write independently and freely, which can be 
proofread and reviewed.
2) Literary appreciation and critique: For Literary appreciation or critique writing, a 
book or a literary piece must be read carefully and repeatedly. The teacher 
encourages students to write the critique without any help. The teacher can then 
explain a few attributes of critique writing (comparing viewpoints, interpreting the 
character’s voice/author’s intent, and assessing the word/content choice).
Teacher’s Voice B-2.6-ii  (To be edited)
Interviews
I am a teacher working with class 6 students. A learning outcome on developing the inter-
viewing skills in students was in the prescribed list of learning outcomes. I designed four 
activities to help my students develop this skill – one of them is described here in detail.
I can speak to and learn from others
Step 1 – To provide students with initial/preliminary experience of interviewing, I gave the 
students a chance to converse with the ayahs, clerks, head teachers and other personnel 
working in the school. and asked them to learn more about their work and areas of interest/
hobbies.
I divided the students into four teams. I told them that they could conduct interviews of the 
school personnel and staff during the break. I also encouraged them to interview whoever 
they wanted/wished to talk to. (At this point, there had been no discussion about the prepa-
ration needed to conduct an interview.)
I ensured that the children were allowed to interview people of their choice during recess. 
While observing the interviews conducted by the children, I identified some key points that 
could be discussed at the next stage.
Step 2 – I put forth a question to the students who had engaged in conducting interviews at 
this stage. “Class, what do you think are the points that you should keep in mind while 
conducting an interview?” I gave each student an opportunity to share their experience. As 
students shared their thoughts and feelings, I recorded/wrote their experiences on the 
blackboard while appreciating the students’ efforts. 
164
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Drawing the attention of the students to specific the points on the blackboard, including 
mutual introduction and statement of purpose, preparation of interview questions, 
punctuality, documentation, I planned to provide opportunities to strengthen their skills 
on these topics.
To start with, I asked the class “Imagine that you are interviewing a farmer. How would you 
make the introduction/ introduce yourselves to each other? Let us act out this situation.” I 
allowed six students to act out this scenario. While the children were engaging in the role 
play and making introductions, I made sure that the purpose of the interview was clearly 
stated and that the other students also notice.
To develop the skill of preparing interview questions in the students, I gave the students a 
list of questions to the students and asked them to identify which questions were appropri-
ate and those that were not. 
Why do you engage in agriculture?
Your efforts are encouraging to all. How has farming made you happy in life?
Isn’t it hard get water for the crops?
What do you feel about people’s over reliance on vehicles?
What were your childhood memories like?
What kind of facilities have you put in place to ensure sufficient water supply to your field?
Will your children continue this work?
How would you encourage your children to continue this work after you?
I also asked them to specify their reasons for deeming certain questions appropriate and 
others as inappropriate.
Following this discussion, to provide students the experience of constructing interview 
questions, I asked the students to create interview questions for a difference situation – that 
of an interview with an Anganwadi teacher.
Upon observing the questions constructed by the students, I reminded them that the ques-
tions should be clear, simple, and relevant to the topic. I also informed them that the ques-
tions should be respectful of the person and of the profession. 
Further, I informed the class that punctuality was important when interviewing someone. 
First, the interviewer (here, the students) had to inform the interviewees the time they 
would require completing the interview and adhere to it.
I then told the class regarding the way to record interviews: I introduced the two mod-
els/examples to record interviews, depending on the purpose of the interview. I provided the 
two samples to the class and asked them to observe the differences between the two. Fur-
ther said to reserve the same model for use in documentation activity. 
165
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
The second activity involved the students watching a video of an interview on my mobile 
phone and discussing it. Following these two activities, I decided to provide practical experi-
ence in conducting interviews and in applying their knowledge to conduct interviews. I told 
the class, “Now, we have understood the method of conducting an interview. Can you con-
duct an interview with any one person of your choice outside the school?” The final activity 
involved narrating and editing the interview they did.
2.6.3 Strategies for the Middle Stage (R3) 
R3 is introduced in the middle stage. The goal is to build basic skills in the R3 language, which 
means students should be able to converse, read, and write in R3. Since the students would have 
already become proficient in their basic skills in R1 And R2, they will acquire these competencies 
much faster given the nature of the transfer of language skills. 
a. Listening and Oral development:
To develop oral proficiency in R3, students must get a chance to listen and converse in that 
language first.
i. 
Listening and talking about movies, plays, and short films: As part of these listening 
activities, the teacher can screen the movies and plays. A pre-viewing and a post-
viewing talk about the movie/play and its significance can be discussed. Students also 
do a detailed review of movies/plays/short films that can be presented orally in the 
classroom.    
ii. 
Engaging in basic conversations: To develop day-to-day speaking skills in the 
language, the teacher can provide relevant imaginary contexts for conversation 
between/among students (E.g., interactions between a shopkeeper and a customer, 
between a teacher and a student, between a doctor and a patient, and so on). After 
Method 1: Recording the Dialogue/
Conversation
Method 2: Summarising with Key Points
Interviewer: In which field have you worked? 
Interviewee: I am originally from a village. At 
first, I studied and worked in a company as an 
engineer. Then, I got interested in agriculture 
and chose this field. Interviewer: What made 
you interested in agriculture? Interviewee: As 
said before, I am originally from a village. 
When I was studying in the town, I used to 
come and do agricultural work in my spare 
time. After joining the company, the modern 
developments in the field of agriculture 
attracted me here.
The respectable farmer was originally from the 
village and later studied to become an engi-
neer. But his interest in agriculture drew him 
back to the village. At present, he is an ideal 
farmer growing many crops in his field.
166
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
acquiring basic conversation skills, students may use real-world issues to discuss and 
debate in the classroom using R3. This will help the students sustain the conversation 
in the targeted language. 
b. Development of reading skills:  
i. 
Script encoding: Since R1 and R2 scripts are already familiar to the students, the 
teacher can straightaway teach the aksharaas and maatras of R3.  Students will learn to 
read letters of the alphabet in R3 much faster as they are older and more experienced 
with languages by now. 
ii. 
Reading comprehension: After teaching the basics of the R3 script, the teacher can 
share small stories and poems for reading comprehension. To help with comprehension 
teachers can give outlines of the text, share its central theme, and explain the difficult 
words. Group reading activities would work well in this context and enable students’ 
confidence in reading too.  
iii. Reading and talking: Students read different kinds of literature in R3 and talk about 
the same. The teacher organizes events (like ‘book for the day’ and ‘author of the day’) 
to help students sustain their interest and improve their talking skills in the language.   
iv. 
Vocabulary building: The use of a dictionary would greatly enable the learning of 
words in R3. Reading comprehension, word-building exercises, and regular use of the 
dictionary for a meaning search will help students in expanding their vocabulary.
v. 
Reading for functional purposes: In R3, the student should get the opportunity to 
read simple manuals (E.g., recipe books and instruction booklets) and other functional 
forms of writing (E.g., samples of letters and invitations).
c. Development of writing skills:
Here, students learn to apply already learned writing strategies (from R1 and R2 languages) 
to write in R3.      
i. 
Introduction to the script: The teacher can introduce the R3 script contextually with 
help of sign boards, nameplates, and invitations (this can help in guessing the letters). 
Immediately after, the teacher may give students writing practice with the aksharas and 
maatras in the language. 
ii. 
 Sentence formation:  After learning the script, the teacher can give students basic 
tasks like writing signboards, nameplates, and invitations. Gradually, they can be given 
the task of writing small conversations helping the students use the language 
coherently.  
iii. Writing for functional use: Even though R3 is meant to be learned at the basic level 
only, writing for functional use is a necessary skill. This can be achieved through simple 
activities like diary writing, letter writing, and short story writing.

Box B-2.6-i
Individual Differences in Classroom Participation 
It is common to find some students in the Middle Stage communicating more freely in the 
classrooms than others. In many cultures, boys are encouraged to interact more freely and 
assertively than girls, and some students from economically privileged backgrounds express 
themselves more confidently than others who come from less privileged backgrounds. 
Students who tend to speak with hesitation for various reasons must be encouraged to 
participate freely in language class activities. Language classes can be a space for empower-
ing students and giving them encouragement and equal opportunities to express themselves 
through reading, speaking, and writing.
2.6.4 Strategies for the Secondary Stage (R1 & R2):
At the secondary level, added to the effective use of language for functional and literary purpos-
es, skills like sound reasoning, argumentation, and reasoning also should be focused on in the 
classroom. Along with these, students must be taught an awareness of the cultural history of 
their languages and literature. To achieve these expectations, we must include a few of the points 
mentioned below in all our teaching methods.
a. Oral presentations:
Since high school students can connect things with their lives easier, the language classroom 
needs to give them opportunities where they can freely share their ideas, should listen to 
others’ points of view, should be free to ask questions, argue on their points and should ac-
cept others’ views with proper justification. Teachers must teach students about the differ-
ences between ‘just talking’ and ‘conversation and dialogue’. Hence students must be taught 
a few things early on like organising their thoughts for better clarity, the art of raising rele-
vant questions, brainstorming and thinking aloud, active participation, and skills of literary 
appreciation.
Teachers must use methods like role play, group discussion, debate, open house dialogue, and 
interviews to allow students to ask questions and learn to respond impromptu. Club-based 
activities, assembly gatherings, and celebrations in the school should be used as platforms to 
practice these methods and should not be seen as a separate exercise. Teachers must also find 
ways to teach students how to work on their listening skills (paying attention to details, sum-
marizing) and use the same in day-to-day life.
b. Developing reading skills:
i. 
Literary language skills: By the time students reach high school, they must have 
learned reading skills and must have also read various kinds of literature in their 
middle school years. At the Secondary Stage level, they must continue to engage with 
comprehension, analysis, reviewing, commenting, and critiquing different kinds of 
literature. For this, they should be encouraged to participate in group activities in 
168
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
critically analysing a literary text in the class and participate in the activities of the 
school literature club, poetry house, and fiction-reading groups. Overall, how students 
read a piece of literature (both in the mechanics of reading and the conceptual 
understanding of the reading) and analyse it is fundamental to any language pedagogy 
in high school.
ii. 
 Critical reading skills: Though they have already learned this in the Middle Stage, the 
teacher must take them to the next level of sophistication in critical reading. For that, 
they must be taught to take meaning from a variety of texts, taught to move from 
initial impressions to a closer reading of the text, and taught to experience the effect of 
the language used in a text for specific purposes. 
iii. Exposure to reading multicultural texts: Students in high school need to be aware 
of languages and literature across the country. Teachers must bring a variety of text 
from different regions, and languages and should encourage students to read it and 
then share views on it. Activities like the literary comparison of two different writers 
should be promoted and cherished. For example, reading the poetry of Amrita Pritam 
and Rabindra Nath Tagore would be a great opportunity for students to experience 
two different regional literature. Similarly reading folk tales of Vikram Betaal and 
Sulasa and Sattuka (Jataka tales) would help students to connect with Indian 
traditions in literature. Projects, plays, performances around folk songs, and posters 
are important methods at this stage for an introduction to ancient text.
c. Developing writing skills: 
i. 
Functional language writing skills: Since functional writing becomes an important 
part of one’s daily life, students at the high school level should be given enough 
opportunity to practice writing reports, essays, notes, applications, letters to editors, 
advertisements, and notices.  Students should also be encouraged to write in 
magazines, newsletters, newspapers, and blogs 
Similarly, being literate about the new media is the need of the hour and any language 
teacher who does not see the pervasiveness of media in the lives of students will 
struggle with them.  Teachers must encourage students to make well-planned and 
scripted videos, start educational YouTube channels, and podcasts and should guide 
students to pick up the right kind of content for these means. Here, the focus should 
be on writing the script for the content than the technical aspect, how a few words in 
a three-second frame of a video can influence the audience, and how a particular 
sentence can be powerful to evoke emotions in any kind of audience. 
ii. 
 Literary language writing skills: At the high school level, the pedagogy should be 
such that students are guided towards independent and creative writing. For this, they 
also need to improve their capacities for critically analysing and thinking. This would 
help them to connect any literature to its historical and socio-economical aspects 
rather than reading it in isolation. After reading, they should be able to write a critical 
review with their thoughts and opinions about the piece. Similarly, students should 
get ample opportunities to create literature in the form of poems, stories, or plays. 
They should be encouraged to use literary devices like similes, metaphors, hyperbole, 
irony, puns, and oxymorons in their writings. Students must be encouraged to find 
169
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
their voice and style as a writer taking cues from the material they read. Journal writing 
can be another brilliant way to take children towards reflective writing. Since writing is 
an acquired skill, the teacher should give constant feedback to help the students 
improve their writing. The feedback of teachers should comprise inputs on students’ 
level of literary skills, proficiency in grammar, and appropriateness of style in writing.

Specific Learning Disabilities in the Language Classroom
Specific Learning Disabilities are a group of conditions that obstruct a person’s ability to 
listen, think, speak, write, spell, or do mathematical calculations. One or more of these 
abilities may be affecting a student at a time. Specific Learning Disability interferes with 
the developmentally predictable learning process of a student. The term does not include 
learning problems that are primarily the result of visual impairment, hearing impair-
ment, motor disabilities, mental retardation, emotional disturbance, or of cultural, envi-
ronmental, or economic disadvantage.
As language classrooms are one of the biggest sites for observation of such learning 
disabilities, teachers must be alert to the presence of any such learning challenges a 
student may be experiencing. 
The Rights of Persons with Disability Act (RPWD) 2016 defines Specific Learning Disabili-
ties as a dissimilar group of conditions wherein there is a deficit in processing language, 
spoken or written, that may show itself as a difficulty to comprehend, speak, read, write, 
spell, or to do mathematical calculations.
Teachers will need to find a professional diagnosis of such disabilities in grade 3 (or at 
eight years of age, whichever is earlier). The school principal, teachers, parents, and the 
clinical psychologist or doctor will have to collaborate to develop learning strategies for a 
student with a learning disability based on the kind and extent of their learning challeng-
es. 
This means framing special considerations in the kind of content selected, the methods of 
pedagogy used, and the assessment tools used for the learning of such a student.

Section 2.7 
Assessments
2.7.1 Formative assessments
This should be part of the teaching-learning process as an ‘assessment for learning’ and ‘assess-
ment as learning’. Giving marks for formative assessment should be avoided as it is to be used for 
the individual progress of learners. Different kinds of tools and techniques like student portfoli-
os, observation sheets, project-based work, and anecdotal records should be part of formative 
assessment.
a. A few tools for formative assessment are worksheets, role play, projects, and oral 
presentations. 
i. 
Worksheets: These are important in the teaching-learning process. Each worksheet will 
help in students’ learning and makes it easy for the teacher to track the learning 
trajectories. But the nature of the worksheets needs some consideration: they should 
not be memory-based and mechanical but should be created in an exploratory manner 
for promoting students’ thinking and reasoning abilities.
ii. 
Role plays: In all three stages, there are many role-plays that can be conducted in the 
class, and for each of them, the teacher can have a checklist of criteria that will help in 
the planning of the activity and the assessment.
iii. Projects: A project work is a planned and formulated piece of study involving a task or 
problem taken up by the learner, either individually or in a group. As projects are great 
self-learning, self-assessing tools, all projects should relate to the learning outcomes. 
The nature of the project and its quality checklist and its expectations can be shared 
with students.
iv. 
Oral presentations: These are useful and make classrooms lively and interactive.

2.7.2 Summative Assessment
Summative assessments can be conducted half-yearly or yearly. The specific purpose is to track 
the children’s progress as per learning outcomes.  Normally these exams are heavily memo-
ry-based, but the real intent of the summative assessment is to assess knowledge, understand-
ing, application, and dispositions. Summative assessment can be quantified, and students can 
receive marks for these. It will help in getting a sense larger picture of the class and learning 
trajectory. Though summative assessment is often a paper-pencil test, teachers can also incorpo-
rate oral tests, projects, and assignments as part of this process.
2.7.3 Techniques for Assessment
a. Portfolios: A portfolio is a file, folder, pocket, or space allocated for each child where actual 
work done by a child, over a period, is collected. It may include written material 
(worksheets, samples of creative writing, test papers, reports of out-of-classroom activities, 
like a visit to the nearby post office, bank, etc.), drawings, pictures, or observations by the 
teachers, observations from others (letters to or by the child to or by friends, family 
members, any other), craftwork (paper folding, paper cutting, origami, greeting cards, etc.), 
collections (leaves, textiles, stamps, list of books, etc.), recordings of oral activities or 
presentations by the child herself or himself (opinion or feelings of self for others, samples 
of self-assessment sheets on questions framed by teachers or even by children themselves).
172
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
b. Anecdotal Records: An anecdotal record is an examination that is written like a short story. 
They are the explanation of occasions or events that are important to the person perceiving 
them. Anecdotal records are short, objective, and as correct as possible.
c. Checklists: Checklists usually offer a yes/no format concerning student illustration of 
criteria. This is like a light switch; the light is either on or off. They may be used in recording 
observations of an individual, a group, or a whole class.
d. Rating Scales: Rating Scales allow teachers to show the degree or frequency of the 
behaviours, skills, and strategies displayed by the learner. To continue the light switch 
analogy, a rating scale is like a feeble switch that provides scope for performance levels.
e. Observation: In observation, information about a child is collected in a natural setting 
inside and outside the classes with the help of observation.
f. Questions: Questions are the frequently applied tool for finding out what children know, 
think, imagine, and feel. A teacher, while teaching, comes to know of learning difficulties in 
children by asking questions. Questions may be of various types like essay-type questions, 
short answer type questions, very short answer type questions, and objective-type 
questions.
Teacher’s Voice B-2.7-i (To be edited)
My journey with assessments
My name is Malavika, and I teach students of class 6. There are a total of 20 children in my 
class. Last week, I was supposed to teach and assess the following learning outcome for the 
children. 
Students explain how authors use characters, conflict, point of view, voice, and tone 
to create meaning with supporting details from the text
This learning outcome has two parts. 
a. Students must read the text and explain their opinion about the characters in it and the 
uniqueness of those characters. 
b. Students identify points of conflict in the text and the tone of the text.  This will require 
them to mark out details in the text and some reasoning. 
So, keeping these in mind, I designed two kinds of activities for the students. I also had to 
plan how to assess the learning outcome. 
Activity 1: The first activity was to read aloud the story to the students and ask them to 
discuss the characters in the story. They were to discuss the main and other characters 
among those. Later in this process, I asked the students to write about something they like 
about a character and how important that character is to the story. 
Reading 1: The Camp by Girija Rani Asthana
Brief description of the story: We rarely do come across people who are willing to help 
others. Such people can change the world with their love and care. Here is an interesting 
story of a village girl who saves her friend’s life. 
173
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Looking at what the students wrote, I regrouped children based on the rubrics I had created 
for the next activity.
a. Level 1: Identifies the main character and supporting characters in the story.
b. Level 2: Writes about why they have liked a particular character in the story.
c. Level 3: Explains how any character is important to the story.
On checking students’ responses, I noticed that 12 students were able to achieve the first 
level and 4 students had reached the second level. The remaining four students struggled to 
achieve level 1, and I read out a different, simpler story to them. These four students then 
discussed the simpler story and wrote about the characters from this story. 
Reading 2: Making A Mango Pickle- Bibhuti Bhushan Bandopadhyay
This revolves around a poor family. The main characters of the story are Apu and Durga. 
Durga is a dark-complexioned beautiful girl, who loves to wander in nature, and Apu is her 
brother. The story reveals the beautiful relationship between the siblings.
This way, all the students learned how to observe and write about characters of a story. I 
put all their writing worksheets into their individual Student Portfolios. 
Activity 2: The second activity was about identifying theme, conflict between characters, 
the author’s viewpoint, voice, and overall tone in the writing. 
Reading 3: The Tiger in the Tunnel by Ruskin bond
Brief description of the story: The story is about an Indian family who faces the difficult 
reality of their existence with a sense of honour and duty. The story highlights through its 
characters’ lives and actions the place of service to society and protectiveness in relation to 
family.
I started the activity with students sharing their overall view of the story, listen to others’ 
views, and discussed the author’s viewpoint. All students expressed their views orally and 
while they presented, I assessed their ability to explain the point of view. For this activity, I 
had put down the following rubrics based on which I regrouped the class students.
a. Level 1: Identifies the main theme of the story.
b. Level 2: Identifies the main theme of the story as well as, distinguish the conflicts between 
the character in the story.
c. Level 3: Can identify the author’s point of view, voice, and tone to create meaning with 
supporting details from the text.
After assessing the students’ performance in the second activity, I realized, they were facing 
some difficulty to reach level 3. 
I came back to class the next day with a few other stories to show the students how to 
identify the author’s point of view, voice, and tone with supporting details from the text. For 
example:    
Reading 4: The Girl and the Mushrooms by Leo Tolstoy
Brief description of the story: Leo Tolstoy’s story about two sisters while carrying mush-
rooms to the home they were about met tian accident but at last everything goes well, this 
story brings out the extent of innocence, heart-wrenching emotions, and love that are the 
hallmarks of kids all over the world.   
174
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
After sufficient examples and conversation for this learning outcome, I decided to consoli-
date the overall performance of the students. I gave them one fresh text (Final reading) and 
asked a list of questions based on characters, conflict, author’s point of view, voice, and tone 
of the text.
Final reading: How Far is the river? by Ruskin Bond
Brief description of the story: How Far is the River by Ruskin Bond is a short story about a 
child who wants to discover a river which he has never seen in his life. Between the boy and 
the river, stands a tall mountain full of shrubs, trees, and forest. The boy is aware that 
beyond that mountain runs a river and he has never seen that river.
List of questions for students:
a. What is the main theme of the story?  
b. Why does the boy want to see the river in the story? 
c. How do you think the boy would have responded if the river was not there even after he 
crossed the mountain? 
d. What is your opinion on the boy character of the story? 
e. What is the author’s voice like across the two to three short stories you have read in the 
class? Can you identify his style of writing in anyway?
Based on the responses, I assessed all the students once again and located their performance 
in three levels as follows.
Level-1
Identifies the main theme, 
character(s), and supporting 
characters in the story
0 to 5 Marks (C)
Tells only characters of the story – 3 marks (in 
question one)
Answers the first question clearly describing the 
theme – 4 to 5 marks.
Level-2 
Identifies the main theme of 
the story as well as distin-
guish the conflicts between 
the character in the story. 
5 to 7 Marks (B)
If a student answers this along with the first 
question (including no 2) clearly - 6 marks 
If a student has answered questions nos. 3 - 7 
marks 
Level-3 
Can identify the point of view, 
voice, and tone to create 
meaning with supporting 
details from the text
7 to 10 Marks (A)
If a student has answered questions no4 - 8 marks 
If the student has answered question number 5 
coherently- 9 to 10 marks

Mathematics Education
Mathematics can be summarized as the art and science of discovering patterns and explaining 
them. As such, Mathematics is both ubiquitous and universal.  It is all around us, in nature, in 
technology, and in the motion of the earth, sun, moon, and stars above. There is Mathematics in 
everything that we do and see, from shopping and cooking, to throwing a ball and playing games, 
to solar eclipses and climate patterns.  Mathematics and numeracy thus give us the fundamental 
ideas and tools required to think about the world around us and the world beyond us. But most 
of all, when taught well, mathematics is truly enjoyable and can become a lifetime passion.   The 
goal of mathematics education is indeed to bring to life these aspects of mathematics.
176
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Mathematics education involves learning creative and logical thinking through fundamental con-
cepts such as numbers and operations, geometry, algebra, probability, and statistics. It also aims 
to nurture the fundamental mathematical capacities of finding patterns, making conjectures, 
providing explanations through logical reasoning, creativity, problem-solving, computational 
thinking, and logical communication (both oral and written). 
In the Foundational Stage, attaining Foundational numeracy (i.e., understanding, and adding 
and subtracting with, Indian numerals) represents the key focus of Mathematics Education. In 
the Preparatory Stage, the focus shifts to the development of concepts such as numbers, basic 
operations (including multiplication and division), shapes, and measurement. In the Middle 
Stage, the emphasis moves towards abstracting some of the concepts learned in the Preparatory 
Stage in order to make them more widely applicable. The Secondary Stage focuses on develop-
ing the ability to justify claims and arguments through logical reasoning. 
177
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Section 3.1 
Aims
Mathematics education develops in the individual not only basic arithmetic skills but also the 
truly crucial capacities of logical reasoning, mental rigor, and creative problem solving. Mathe-
matical knowledge also plays a crucial role in understanding the contents of other school sub-
jects such as science, social science, and even sports, visual arts, and music.
NEP 2020 states that ``It is recognized that Mathematics and mathematical thinking will be very 
important for India’s future and India’s leadership role in the numerous upcoming fields and pro-
fessions that will involve artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science, etc.’’  (Para 4.25)
The specific aims of Mathematics Education are to develop:
a. Capacities such as finding patterns, making conjectures, justification with logical reasoning, 
creativity, problem solving, computational thinking, and clear communication (both oral 
and written). 
b. Conceptual and procedural knowledge of numbers, operations, geometry, algebra, 
probability, and statistics.
c. Values such as rigor and integrity in communication and formulation of arguments; and 
dispositions such as curiosity, wonder, and perseverance.

Section 3.2 
Nature of Knowledge
Unlike any other subject, the notion of truth in mathematics is absolute.  In other words, once 
assumptions (sometimes called axioms) are agreed upon, and a mathematical truth is estab-
lished based on those assumptions through logical and rigorous reasoning (sometimes called 
proof), then that truth cannot be refuted or debated and is true for all time.   On occasion, math-
ematicians may find completely new logical arguments or proofs to establish the same truth, and 
this too is considered a breakthrough; this is because mathematics is not just a collection of 
truths, but is also a framework of methods, tools, and arguments used to arrive at these truths.
Over thousands of years, the mathematical truths that are known to humans have grown in num-
ber and scope.  Quite often, new mathematical truths that are discovered and established build 
on previously known truths. For that reason, mathematical education, like mathematics knowl-
edge, is cumulative—new concepts that are learned often build on those learned previously.
Mathematical knowledge is built through finding patterns, making conjectures (i.e., proposed 
truths), and then verifying/refuting those conjectures through logical and rigorous reasoning 
(i.e., through a proof or a counterexample). The process of finding patterns, making conjectures, 
and finding proofs or counterexamples often involves a tremendous amount of creativity, sense 
of aesthetics, and elegance. Often there are many different ways to arrive at the same mathemat-
ical truth, and many different ways of solving the same problem. It is for that reason that mathe-
maticians often refer to their own subject as more of an art than a science. 
Mathematics education too therefore must aim to develop in students that sense and apprecia-
tion of the creativity, beauty, and elegance of mathematics. In classroom discussions, patterns 
should require creativity to discover, and creativity to explain; problems should require creativ-
ity to solve and should, in many cases, allow for multiple approaches--some of which the teacher 
herself may not be aware of--as this is the nature of the discovery of mathematical knowledge.

Section 3.3 
Key Challenges
Our current education system has faced multiple challenges with respect to mathematics 
learning. 
a. Currently, a large proportion of students in the early grades are not achieving foundational 
literacy and numeracy. This makes it difficult for students to achieve any further higher 
learning in mathematics.  Attaining foundational literacy and numeracy for all children must 
therefore become an immediate national mission and a central goal of the Foundational 
Stage curriculum.
b. At both the foundational and higher stages, mathematics learning has traditionally been 
more `robotic’ and `algorithmic’ rather than creative and aesthetic. This is a 
misrepresentation of the nature of mathematics and must be addressed in the school 
curriculum.
c. There have been some unfortunate practices that have discouraged many girls from 
pursuing mathematics. Girls possess abilities in mathematics equal to boys and must be 
given equal opportunity to pursue mathematics and equal participation in the processes of 
mathematical discovery. 
d. New mathematical concepts are difficult to absorb by young children when these concepts 
are not connected to students’ home experiences and languages. Textbooks, classroom 
activities, and examples should aim to be connected to and related to students’ lives and 
presented also in students’ home languages whenever possible.  Mathematical vocabulary 
should additionally be given in students’ home languages in cases where the medium of 
instruction is different from the student’s home/most familiar language. 
e. Methods of assessment too have encouraged rote learning and meaningless practice and 
have thus promoted the perception of mathematics as mechanical computation. Assessment 
must move towards testing real understanding – i.e., core mathematical capacities and 
competencies - rather than mechanical procedures and rote learning.  
f. Ultimately, many students in the current system have unfortunately developed a real fear of 
mathematics. This has occurred due to non-optimal teaching methods involving lectures, 
rote learning, and meaningless practice, rather than interactive learning involving games, 
activities, and discussions emphasising the creative side of mathematics.  Countering this 
fear of mathematics would require a shift in teaching-learning methods towards play-based, 
activity-based, discovery-based, and discussion-based learning.

Box B-3.3-i
 
Fear of Mathematics
There are two major aspects that cause fear of mathematics; (a) the nature of the subject 
and how it is being taught and (b) how it is being perceived in the society.
a. Nature of Mathematics and how it is taught: 
i. 
The concepts in Mathematics are cumulative in nature. If students struggle with 
place value, then certainly they will struggle with all four basic operations, decimal 
numbers and hence in word problems. So, as a teacher we need to prepare plan in 
such a way that we can work with students of different level in different methods 
by using teaching learning materials (TLMs) to engage student and learn the 
concepts so that the child can feel comfortable to learn the new concepts that are 
connected to the previously learnt concepts.
ii. When symbols – part of the ‘language’ of Mathematics – are manipulated without 
understanding, after a point, boredom and bewilderment dominate for many 
students, and dissociation develops. So, it is important for teacher to start teaching 
the concept connecting to the real-life using the local language (especially up to 
Preparatory Stage), provide exposure to explore using concrete objects or 
examples and gradually shift to the language of mathematics. 
iii. Most of the assessment techniques and questions focus on facts, procedure, and 
memorisation of formulas. However, the assessment should focus on 
understanding, reasoning, when and how a mathematical technique is to be used 
in different context is important.
d. Societal perceptions and expectations:
i. 
Prevalent social attitudes which see girls as incapable of mathematics, or 
association of formal computational abilities with the upper castes. Such social 
discriminations also cause the fear and anxiety in students. We need to break that 
belief exist in the society.
ii. Due to immense competition in the world to be a successful person, parents are 
burdening the students with immense pressure without considering the interest 
of students. Majorly it is observed that parents expect their child to choose career 
in science stream and that puts pressure on the children to learn Mathematics.
Hence, we must rethink the approach of teaching where students see mathematics as a part 
of their life, enjoy mathematics, with a greater focus on reasoning and creative problem 
solving. Also, at the same time we need to work with the society to understand the objective 
of education and some of the beliefs that cause harm to the learning of the students

3.4.2 Rationale for Selection of Concepts
The Learning Standards – the Curricular Goals, Competencies, and Learning Outcomes – defined 
here makes choices for the concepts that will be taught and learnt in each of the Stages. The key 
principles that underlie these choices are described here. 
a. Principle of essentiality
This principle involves three key questions: What mathematics is essential to learn so that 
one can solve one’s day to day problems, live a normal life, and be able to ably participate in 
the democratic processes of the country? What mathematics is essential to be able to ade-
quately understand other essential school subjects, such as science and social science? And, 
finally, what mathematical ideas are essential for developing interest in students to further 
pursue the intellectual discipline if one desires to do so? 
b. Principle of coherence
Concepts that are selected for each Stage must be in coherence with each other and with the 
overall and Stage-specific Curricular Goals, Competencies and Learning Outcomes. The goal 
must not be to bombard the child with all mathematical concepts at the expense of coherence.
c. Principle of practicality and balance
Due to a rush for completing the syllabus, the focus on building conceptual understanding 
often gets compromised and rote memorisation of formulae and direct use of algorithms be-
comes a central part of the teaching process. NEP 2020 strongly recommends reducing con-
tent to give time to discussion, analytical thinking, and fully appreciating concepts. 
At each Stage, while choosing the concepts for mathematics, we have given emphasis to the 
idea of balancing content load with discussion, analytical thinking, and true conceptual un-
derstanding. The selection of concepts in each stage must aim to increase the space for bal-
191
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
ancing between the conceptual and procedural understanding of the concepts. This will cre-
ate space for teachers to focus more on building conceptual understanding and meaningful 
practice.      
With this rationale, Learning Standards have been configured to give emphasis to understand 
Mathematics as a discipline by the end of Grade 10 so that students can also appreciate its intrin-
sic beauty and value and thereby pursue higher education in mathematics. All areas and con-
cepts that are necessary for all students in daily life to interact with the world are covered within 
Grade 10 so that if they decide to drop mathematics after Grade 10, they are still equipped with 
necessary skills, concepts, and Competencies in mathematics. At every Stage, all concepts are 
included that may be needed as prerequisites for concepts in later Stages.

Section 3.5 
Content Selection
3.5.1 Principles for Content Selection 
To have better teaching and learning experiences, the following principles would be followed 
while choosing the content for the mathematics classroom. Stagewise principles are laid down; 
for each Stage, principles for the previous Stage may also be considered wherever applicable.
3.5.1.1 
Preparatory Stage 
a. Plenty of space to be given to children’s local context and surroundings for developing 
concepts in mathematics. Case studies, stories, situations from daily life, and vocabulary and 
phrasing in the home language should be brought in to help introduce and unfold a concept 
and its sub-concepts. 
b. We need to encourage the development of a culture of learning outside the classroom. More 
play way activities to be included in the content.
c. Mathematics is about thinking in a certain way and providing logical arguments to support 
the reasoning. Avenues for this are to be created in all activities, projects, assignments, and 
exercises. Encourage children to articulate their reasons behind their observations and 
guesses/conjectures, e.g., ask them: why is a pattern extending in a certain way and what is 
the rule behind it? 
d. Language of the content is to be simple so that students can also express their thoughts 
using similar language; gradually increase their vocabulary and guide them to be specific 
(using mathematical vocabulary, symbols, and notation).
e. Content that encourages learning processes (meaningful practice leads to building memory 
and procedural fluency) and cognitive skills (reasoning, comparing, contrasting, and 
classifying), as well as the acquisition of specific mathematical capacities.
f. There should be consistency and coherence across the content and the progression of the 
concepts should be spiral instead of linear.
g. For content selection, focus should be on activities that are engaging, i.e., built around daily 
life experiences of children. It should cater to more than one learning objective/Competency 
simultaneously and take in to account one or more learning areas at the same time. 
h. Definitions should naturally evolve at the end of the discussion, as students develop clear 
understanding of a concept. 
i. Content selection should be carried out keeping in mind the needs of diverse students – 
differently abled and children with learning disabilities.
j. Develop awareness for the need for national integration, protection of environment, 
observance of small family norms, removal of social barriers, and elimination of gender 
biases.
193
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
3.5.1.2 
Middle Stage
a. Content should allow children to explore several strategies for solving a problem.
b. Content should have situations and problems that offer multiple correct answers. For this, 
open-ended questions should be given more space in the exercises. 
c. Problem posing is an important part of doing mathematics. Exercises that require children 
to formulate and create a variety of problems for their peers and others should be encour-
aged.
d. Content should allow children to explore, create, appreciate, and understand instead of just 
memorising concepts and algorithms without understanding the rationale behind how they 
work.
e. Content should offer meaningful practice (through worksheets, games, puzzles, etc.) that 
leads to working memory (smriti) and ultimately builds a procedural/computational 
fluency.
f. 
Mathematics should emerge as a subject of exploration, discovery, and creativity rather 
than a mechanical subject.
g. Content should give opportunities to naturally motivate the usefulness of abstraction.
Teacher’s Voice B-3.5-i [to be edited]
Teaching Aids
Teaching aids, in my opinion, are a big assistance in maintaining students’ attention in the 
classroom and, consequently, in learning. The use of manipulatives and visual representa-
tions is quite effective, along with the symbolic language in teaching of math concepts. 
For example, to teach the circumference of a circle, what I do is that I asked the each student 
to draw a circle of any radius. Then I asked them to measure the length of the boundary of 
the circle using the thread. Then with the help of the ruler find the length of the thread used 
to completely cover the boundary without stretching the thread. Diameter they can easily 
know by just doubling the radius of the circle. 
Now I asked each of them to fill the data (2nd and 3rd column) in the table drawn on the 
white board as below – 
S.No.
Circumference or 
length of the thread (C)
Diameter (D)
Ratio of Circumference 
to Diameter
194
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
In next step, I asked them to find the ratio of Circumference to the diameter in each case and 
write in the last column. When the students divide the circumference by the diameter, they 
will all have about the same answer of about 3.142. Then I introduced them with this 
constant which is famously called as Pi and denoted by a Greek symbol ‘π’.
Follow up question I put to them is – if we know the diameter or radius of any circle then 
can we find the circumference of the circle. My students easily comes with the response as 
yes with explanation as below – 
Since, C/D= Π which remains a constant for all circles.
Hence, C= Π ×D
Or  
C= Π ×2r
Or  
C= 2Πr
The use of teaching aids makes students active throughout the 
lesson and enhances understanding and retention of mathematical concepts.
3.5.1.3 
Secondary Stage
a. Content should be chosen and designed in a way that it enables the students to understand 
notions of abstraction, the axiomatic system, and deductive logic. 
b. More project-based work should be designed and given space in the content so that 
students have opportunities to weave together several concepts simultaneously. This will 
help students appreciate the unity and inter-relatedness of mathematical concepts.
c. Interdisciplinary approaches should be kept in consideration while designing the content. 
Project-based work could be designed based on themes to ensure the integration of other 
subjects.
d. Content at this Stage should allow students to develop and consolidate the mathematical 
knowledge and skills acquired during the Middle Stage.
e. Students should develop necessary skills to work with tools, modern technological devices, 
and mathematical software useful in mathematical discovery and learning.
f. Content should highlight the history of mathematics and how mathematical concepts 
developed, and in particular the contributions of Indian and other mathematicians in the 
development of mathematics knowledge.
195
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
3.5.2 Materials and Resources
Materials and resources form a critical part of content based on such principles of selecting con-
tent for teaching and learning of Mathematics. These include:
a. Concrete materials: Teaching–learning materials can be useful resources that make 
learning experiences more interesting and enjoyable. Such material can be used in 
understanding concepts, practice, and in assessment. These resources facilitate students to 
comprehend subject concepts effectively as they can correlate the verbal instruction with 
real experience, assist students to learn effectively, and remember concepts for long, help 
students to comprehend concept with clarity, help students to concretise abstract concepts, 
and thereby enhances the comprehension, reduce verbal communication on the part of 
teachers, and help students to develop curiosity, and interest in learning. Math Space or 
corner can be established in a school/classroom, which will have various equipment, 
apparatus, charts, models: working and static, etc., that can help in building the learning of 
abstract concepts in mathematics by having experimentation, activities, hands on 
experience, verification, etc. In mathematics laboratory, electronic calculator, graph 
machines, mathematical games, puzzles, a mathematical kit containing ginmala, bundle-
sticks, geo-board, algebra tiles, dienes blocks or flat long cards, dominoes, pentominoes, 
Mathematics-related videos, and inclinometers, etc. can also be made available.
b. Textbooks: Textbooks should provide authentic content knowledge, content selected 
should be familiar as much as possible for the students particular to state or region. It 
should be logical, coherent, and sequential keeping in mind the nature of mathematics – 
formation of concepts from concrete to abstract, progression of concepts – building of new 
concepts on previously learnt concepts, language – used in the textbook needs to be simple, 
and comprehensible, should give space to students to build their own definitions and 
gradually start using mathematical terms etc. Content chosen should be in alignment with 
the pedagogical instructional practices specific to mathematics (stated above in section 9.8). 
Concepts and propositions need to be explained with examples and illustration, lots of 
opportunities to learn by doing. Enough space for meaningful deliberate practice for better 
understanding of the conceptual understanding and to build procedural and computational 
fluency. 
c. Workbooks: Workbooks are a very useful and helpful tool in the teaching and learning of 
mathematics. Worksheets for a workbook can be designed to fulfil three purposes (a) 
Introducing a new concept, (b) Practice and drill for better understanding of the concept 
and for procedural & computational fluency, and (c) Worksheets can be used as assessment 
tools also for the learnt concepts. 
d. Technology: Technology provides additional opportunities for students to see and interact 
with mathematical concepts. Students can explore and make discoveries with games, 
simulations, and digital tools. One excellent platform is ‘Desmos’ the web-based graphing 
calculator, another is Geo-gebra and there are many more digital tools which make the 
teaching of mathematics more interesting and joyful.

Section 3.6 
Pedagogy
Children begin learning much prior to the time when they come to school. They start learning 
from their routine experiences, from their surroundings, such as while playing games or inter-
acting with the people around. By the time they join formal schooling, they already have learnt 
many concepts. Formal learning of mathematics depends a lot on the knowledge and experienc-
es that children bring with them to school. Children learn in several ways and teachers ought to 
have this understanding about their learning, so that they can enrich children’s experiences and 
existing knowledge in all teaching learning processes. 
Children can learn from anything that they watch being carried out around them. They continue 
to learn beyond school hours. When a child spends substantiate amount of time engaged with 
solving a jigsaw puzzle, adults often perceive and label it as a time-wasting activity. Instead, they 
need to realise that it is through such interesting games that the children may be increasing their 
understanding of shapes and size by continuously improving the visualisation skill. A curriculum 
built upon assumptions about children’s learning that ignore these aspects, is also responsible 
for children losing interest in mathematics in particular or in any formal learning in general.
Children learn when they are provided with opportunities to engage with meaningful multiple 
concrete experiences through which they draw common properties which then form a concept. 
In this process of formation of concept child needs to be exposed to a variety of concrete experi-
ences which they can describe in their own language followed by visual experiences through 
pictures that represents their experiences and then with symbols to form better understanding 
of a concept. This progression in learning any concept is quite appropriate in the Preparatory 
Stage. 
For children, problem solving as well as problem posing are critical steps in learning mathemat-
ics. Solving mathematics problems and the process of problem solving, although are different, 
have a lot of similarity in understanding the problem, suggesting, and trying out different possi-
ble procedures of solution. Problem solving abilities can be developed when we encourage chil-
dren in solving the problems independently or in groups without providing any direct support. 
Besides promoting problem solving abilities in children, they should be encouraged to pose 
problems. Posing relevant problems indicates the level of understanding of the concepts, pro-
cesses, and procedures of mathematics. Children could be encouraged for such deliberate prac-
tices in the classroom as much and as frequently as possible.
Children learn with interest when they are involved in some discovery process in which they 
have to recognise how to find out things and think on their own. In fact, in this process students 
become less dependent on getting knowledge from teachers and acknowledge the conclusion of 
others. Discovery learning allows learners to see in what way knowledge is achieved. In this stu-
dent to be enabled to learn by gathering, organising, and analysing information to achieve their 
own conclusion. 
197
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
In any effective teaching-learning process, it is inevitable that the Teacher should employ im-
pactful practices to ensure learning of the students. For this to happen, the Teacher should have 
the firm belief that all students have the potential to learn and do Mathematics. The Teacher 
should use culturally relevant practices and differentiated learning experiences to meet learning 
needs of the diverse students. The focus should be on the development of conceptual under-
standing with procedural fluency, effective communication, creative problem solving, and other 
mathematical skills. Effective teaching practices in the mathematics classroom must be support-
ed by an inclusive, positive, and safe learning environment, where students feel valued and en-
gaged.
The teaching of Mathematics should be ground on this understanding of how children learn 
Mathematics. The rest of this section describes key instructional practices and methods that are 
useful in Mathematics teaching. It also describes the aspect of multi-level and remedial teaching 
that Teachers often encounter in Mathematics classrooms. Finally, it gives attention to how to 
cater to specific learning difficulties.
3.6.1 Instructional practices 
a. Instruction should help students to understand a particular mathematical concept and 
encourage students to use various representations for deeper understanding of each 
concept, as each representation provides a different perspective. 
b. The Teacher should focus on building understanding of the concept, encourage them to 
express their understanding in their own words using mathematical vocabulary and terms 
(including in their own home language when different from the medium of instruction).
c. The Teacher should provide opportunities to engage in meaningful discussions involving 
questions that require explanations (“How could you explain your thinking to someone just 
learning this?”, “How do you know?”).
d. Incorporate problem-solving tasks in classroom that encourage students to reason, 
communicate, represent, and connect, as well as justify their thinking. 
e. Effective use of tools and representations (particularly pictorial or physical representations) 
can help students to think through a problem and devise strategies for solution. Tools and 
representations assist students in modelling situations concretely, pictorially, and abstractly.
f. Teachers should spend some time daily to support mental Mathematics and visualisation 
strategies, including solving questions involving computation that will help them build 
computational fluency, solving puzzles, answering riddles, and playing games.
g. Small group work can be effective for better learning and for promoting peer learning. 
Group work may include problem solving, group discussion and reasoning, proving, etc. 
However, it should be of small duration so as to manage the groups effectively. 
h. Meaningful practice should be an integral part of the Mathematics classroom through the 
use of worksheets, puzzles, games, mental and oral Mathematics, group work, and 
homework involving paper and pencil. Practice should be meaningful and purposeful.

Discovery-Based Method 
My understanding of ‘Discovery-Based Method of Teaching’ is a teaching strategy in 
which teachers assist students in discovering mathematical facts and formulas through 
organized activities and observations. In this approach the teacher provides the neces-
sary teaching materials and guides the students to carry out some activities which would 
lead the students to arrive at a new knowledge. Such discovery activities could be done 
individually or in small groups of students. This approach enables students to actively 
participate in the learning process and discover things for themselves. For instance, to 
teach the students that the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180˚, I asked students to 
draw their triangles, measure the three angles and add them together. The students 
would discover that the sum of the angles is 180˚. 
Alternatively, I asked them to draw triangles on papers, cut out the three angles and 
arrange them together to form a straight line and the sum of angles on a straight line is 
180˚. So instead of telling them the mathematical knowledge as just facts it is always 
better to apply discovery approach which enhances active learning in the mathematics 
classroom. Same exercise I repeat for sum of the angles of a quadrilateral is 360˚. Here, 
students are to draw any quadrilateral, measure the four angles and add to discover that 
it is 360˚. Then like they did for triangles I asked them to draw different quadrilateral and 
cut out the angles from the corners and join them to meet their all four vertices at a point 
without leaving any gap as shown below to form a complete angle i.e. 360˚.
Here, my emphasis is always on to design activities that help my students learn mathemati-
cal concepts instead of just memorizing them as facts and formulas.

3.6.2 Some suggested methods of teaching
a. Play-way (activity based) method: Play-way or activity-based method helps in developing 
desirable attitudes and skills. It gives confidence to students. Many types of games and toys 
are now available to students which have their roots in mathematical concepts or ideas. 
These games use patterns, quizzes, and puzzles. Many types of dominoes, number checkers, 
counting frames, patterns of magic squares, puzzle boards or blocks are now easily available 
or can be made locally. These may be effectively used for teaching in the classroom.
b. Discovery/Inquiry-based method: This method allows students to explore academic 
content by posing, investigating, and answering questions. It demands complete self-activity 
of self-learning on the part of the student. Through this method, the student learns to 
reason and that helps in the development of a scientific attitude. It also allows students to 
draw connections between academic content and their own lives, which can be particularly 
important for culturally and linguistically diverse students.
c. Problem solving method: Word and logic puzzles (including grid-process-of-elimination 
puzzles) are a fun way to teach deductive reasoning. Simple puzzles can help develop in 
students’ skills of logical and creative thinking in an enjoyable manner (DNEP 2020, Sec. 
4.6.5 pg.93).
d. Inductive method: Inductive method is based on principle of induction. Induction means to 
establish a universal truth by showing that if it is true for a particular case and is further 
true for a reasonably adequate number of cases then it is true for all such cases. Thus, 
inductive method of teaching leads us from known to unknown, particular case to general 
rule and from concrete to abstract. When a number of concrete cases have been understood, 
the student is able to attempt for generalisation. Here only various facts and examples are 
presented to the students and from where they have to find out rules or establish a general 
formula.
e. Deductive method: Deduction is the process by which a particular fact is derived from 
some general known truths. Thus, in the deductive method of teaching student proceeds 
from general to particular, abstract to concrete and from formula to examples. Here a 
pre-established rule or formula is given to the student, and they are asked to solve the 
related problems by using that formula or to prove theorems using definitions, axioms and 
postulates.
All of the above methods are suggestive and have their appropriateness at different Stages and 
with students of different age groups. It is also true that one method does not work for all stu-
dents and Teacher has to intelligently choose a combination of methods to ensure the learning of 
every individual. The matrix below has suggestive methods in rows and Stages in three columns.

3.6.3 Multi-Level and Remedial Teaching
a. Multi-level teaching in regular class: In a multi-level mathematics classroom teaching 
process, the Teacher starts with the pre-requisite concepts and in the initial few classes, the 
Teacher may not require working at different levels, but as classes go on, the Teacher needs 
to work with different learning levels of the students. Let’s understand the multi-level 
Grade with an example.  
Context: There are 30 students in Grade 4 and Teacher is planning to teach the concept of 
fraction.
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
         Table B-3.6-ii

Equal division (Whole class activity):
a. Fold the paper or divide the shape into two/four equal parts.
b. Identify shapes that are equally divided into two/four equal parts.

a. Fold a rectangular paper into two parts and color one part. The color part is half.
b. Do the same process with different shapes.
c. Ask students to show half using different object and shapes.
d. Extend the discussion to write in symbol as 1/2.
Assessment: Identify half and 1/2. Shaded 1/2 of the given figures.
Observation: Out of 30 students,
a. 7 students are marking unequal divisions as 1/2.

201
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Group 1 (7 students)
a. After assigning the task to group 2. 
Teacher will work with the 7 students 
and focus on the issues of equal division 
through various objects and shapes.
b. Provide some more questions to those 
students to ensure the learning.
c. Based on the time available and level of 
students, Teacher can assign one high-
er-order thinking question like - How 
many ways you can divide the shape into 
half?
Group 2 (23 students)
a. Teacher will make groups of 4-5 students. 
Ask them to solve and discuss on the 
questions.
b. Assign few questions discussed in the last 
day with some higher-order thinking 
questions like –
i. How many ways you can divide the 
shape into half? 
ii.  Write the fraction representing the 
shaded part. 
c. After assigning task to Group 1, Teacher 
will observe the copy of students and can 
ask questions to trigger their under-
standing.
If the mistakes made by group 1 are resolved, then in the next day Teacher will focus on 
identifying and writing 1/4, 3/4 with whole group. Else continue to work with group 1 and 
assign questions of 1/4 and 3/4 to group 2.
 
b. Remedial teaching: Remedial teaching is a short-term engagement. The concepts chosen 
for discussion in the remedial classes could be concepts from regular classes or any basic 
conceptual mistakes like – Operation on numbers or algebraic expressions. 
Suppose in Grade 5, the Teacher observes 
that three students are making mistakes 
in subtraction of numbers with regroup-
ing of the types below.

            -   527
Teacher plans remedial classes for the 
three students, using the dienes blocks and worksheets. First, Teacher explains a subtraction 
problem (as in the figure) using the blocks, stepwise by regrouping and connecting it with the 
algorithm. Then, Teacher will assign similar problems and will ask the students to explain 
using the dienes blocks. When Teacher is assured that students are able to solve, Teacher will 
assign more questions of similar types for practice. Students can use dienes blocks if they face 
difficulty. When Teacher observes that they are able to solve the problems, the remedial class-
es for those students will be completed.

3.6.4 Learning Difficulties
Many students find difficulties in understanding and manipulating numbers, learning facts and 
processes related to mathematical operations, use of rules and formulae, measurement, spatial 
understanding, keeping information in their working memory, etc. 
Students with learning difficulties struggle to achieve desired Competencies within the expected 
time frame due to sensory impairment (weaknesses in vision or hearing); behavioural and emo-
tional issues; language used in school (medium of instruction, terminologies used in Mathemat-
ics classroom) and home are different, high absenteeism; teaching without empathy, less expo-
sure or inadequate curriculum. 
Many concepts in mathematics are hierarchical in nature, it’s very important for any student to 
have understanding of previous/linked concepts, algorithm, and processes. Word problems are 
often challenging for students with learning difficulties because reading and understanding the 
problem, concepts and process required are prerequisite skills to solve word problems.
For students with a learning difficulty, diagnosis of the challenges and issues are very important. 
Discussion with student, parents & peers for support to find the causes and to plan accordingly. 
There may be following strategies that may help the teacher - 
a. Continuous support, encouragement, and motivation to the students.
b. Use of appropriate teaching learning material (TLM) and visual representations.
c. Creating more opportunities for doing, sharing and to revise basic concepts like numbers, 
operations, rules etc. in routine manner. 
d. Recapitulation of key previous concepts/process before introducing the new concept/s. 
e. Allowing students to think aloud while they work.
f. Assigning problems/assignments for practice to engage meaningfully through discovery, 
problem solving and inquiry method.
g. At Preparatory Stage, more play-way methods to be employed. Games, puzzles, riddles 
should be included more and more to deal with the concepts. Exposure to be given with 
concrete materials and experiences from their daily life. 
h. Keep fair balance between building conceptual understanding of concepts and procedural 
understanding to solve problems. Avoid practice which supports rote memorisation and 
solving problems using algorithms directly without going into how algorithms work.

Section 3.7 
Integrating Mathematics with Other 
Curricular Areas 
An interdisciplinary approach offers students to expand themselves beyond one subject domain 
by allowing them to tackle problems that do not fit exactly into one subject. It also changes how 
students learn by asking them to synthesize multiple perspectives, instead of driving their 
thoughts unidirectionally based on the understanding of one discipline. It allows students to 
explore and involves multiple perspective and dimensions from different curricular areas to deal 
with daily life problems. Hence, integration of mathematics with other curricular areas is im-
portant to develop interest in the subject and build holistic view of the purpose of education. 
Mathematics learning could be made more meaningful and interesting by integrating other cur-
ricular areas and use them as a medium of teaching-learning processes, like:
a. Integrating mathematics and arts: Art and Mathematics are closely linked through 
several concepts. Most importantly, both these disciplines play an important role in under-
standing patterns, as well as enhancing spatial abilities and visualisation. Integrating the 
arts with mathematics would need to not only include art activities that engage students in 
creating visual patterns, tessellations, and making origami, the pedagogy could also include 
an exposure to examples of artworks that contain interesting patterns. Students need to be 
exposed to the deeper connections between these two disciplines. Some ideas for integrat-
ing the arts in the Mathematics classroom could be:
i. 
Learning a variety of rangoli patterns, with dots matrices and without dots. Analysing 
various rangoli patterns e.g., estimating the number of unbroken lines used in a sikku 
kolam/kambi kolam.
ii. Creating origami and then opening it back to its original form of a flat paper, to analyse 
how two-dimensional forms become three-dimensional forms. During this exercise, 
students can observe the crease patterns, symmetries and angles that are at play. 
Similar activities can be done with commonly used packaging material like cardboard 
cartons to study the transformations from 2D to 3D.
iii. Recognising the geometries in architecture e.g., comparing the different shapes of 
buildings, monuments, and their ground plans.
iv. Recognising the geometries in visual arts e.g., images of artworks by abstract artists, 
Buddhist mandala paintings, and so on can be used as visual triggers to discuss shapes, 
colours, and patterns.
v. Symmetry can be explored through dance and movement by assigning mirroring 
exercises for students. This concept can also be explored through visual games, self-
designed board games, simple print-making activities based on traditional art forms 
like Rogan printing, and by viewing examples of architecture, painting, and sculpture.
vi. Pattern activities could also include art forms like weaving, embroidery, and bead work 
where patterning is heavily reliant on mathematical precision, grids and matrices.
204
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
vii. Ratio and proportion are fundamental to the arts- the technique of drawing the human 
body requires an understanding of proportion e.g., the length of an arm is about thrice 
the length of the head. The study of ratio and proportion can also be related to different 
cultures and their canons of beauty being defined by specific ratios and proportions.
viii. Music is rife with patterns. The joy of making music lies in creating innumerable 
permutations and combinations of patterns by grouping notes, sounds, and beats. 
Tempo determines how notes can be combined and fitted into specific rhythm cycles in 
multiple variations. Music is an extremely useful way to understand fractions since it 
uses full notes, half-notes, quarter-notes, and one-eighth notes which also related to 
tempo in terms of ek gun, dugun, trigun, chaugun. Improvisation in the classical forms 
of music require an immense alertness and ability to do mental math. For example, 
creating note patterns in multiples of 3, 5, or 7 in a 4-beat rhythm can be both 
challenging and aesthetically pleasing. The way frequencies are chosen in music also 
involves understanding simple fractions, due to what sounds good and most resonant 
to the ear.  For example, the ratio of frequencies of the top and bottom Sa in a saptak is 
2:1, and the ratio of frequencies of Pa and Sa is 3:2.  There are reasons from physics 
(namely, the notion of resonance) as to why particular combinations of notes sound 
good to the ear, and the notes (shrutis) that are used in Indian classical music (and also 
in music around the world), as explained in Bharata’s Natyashastra, are based on 
simple whole number ratios of frequencies. 
b. Integrating Mathematics and Sports – Teaching Mathematics through sports could be 
fun for most of the students those who really struggle in understanding the concepts in 
Mathematics. Through sports concepts related to measurement and mensuration could be 
easily taught and related unit conversion can also be discussed simultaneously. Similarly, 
many geometrical shapes can be discussed on the field like angles, triangles, circles etc. 
Many concepts from data handling, statistics and probability are closely linked with almost 
all the sports like averages, drawing different types of graphs, and interpreting them, 
calculating the chance of winning etc. 
Similarly, other curricular areas can also be integrated with Mathematics to understand and see 
more meaning of Mathematics in daily life.

Integrating Mathematics and Language 
Integrated mathematics and language classroom helps me to utilize my time better in a 
classroom while working on the skills of the students in both subjects. 
In my plan, I selects activities that could serve the objectives for both the subjects. This helps 
me to channelize my work and energy better as I am single teacher so as to optimize the 
learning of my students in both fundamental subjects and I also use valuable time in my 
classroom to the fullest.   
With current need as also laid out clearly in per NEP 2020 about emphasis on literacy and 
numeracy, it makes great sense to combine these two subjects. I wanted to share one exam-
ple on how stories could be used to teach both language and mathematics together.  
205
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Using stories to promote recognition of conservation of number or fractions: To an adult, it’s 
obvious that three apples on a table that are moved to a floor are still three apples. But to a 
student, who needs to learn conservation of number it is not. Student who lacks this under-
standing has to re-count the apples to be sure.
It is simple to enhance understanding of number conservation by using several picture 
books. To keep track of and count moving things, I use books like The Alphabet Room, which 
has the added benefit of teaching the alphabet. Simply say, “I see the apples moved. Right 
now, how many apples are there? Do the three remain? Where are they? Let us count.
Dialogue can change into a discussion around fraction, if your students can already see at a 
look that there are still three apples. Well, the apples are arranged with one-third on the 
left. The remaining two-thirds are missing; where are they? This way building understand-
ing of math concept using the content from language could be used together.

Section 3.8 
Assessment
3.8.1 Formative Assessment 
While the teaching-learning process is going on, it is important for Teacher to assess and monitor 
the student’s learning focusing on identifying different levels of learning, appropriateness of the 
activity for the Grade, finding out what the student has learnt. Continuous assessment during 
teaching-learning will also provide inputs/feedback to Teacher to improve the teaching meth-
ods.
3.8.1.1 
Preparatory Stage
Learning mathematics at this Stage should encourage the development of a culture of learning by 
linking with experiences outside the classrooms and by giving interesting exercises. The focus is 
on utilising students’ present interests and enthusiasms as opportunities for developing the con-
cepts in mathematics. It stresses on giving particular attention to allow the students to articulate 
their reasons behind doing an exercise in a certain way, e.g., why do they want to continue a pat-
tern in a particular way? While teaching-learning process is going on, Teacher observes and as-
sesses-
a. Which student is actively participating in the discussion and contributing to it and which 
student is not able to do so. 
b. Whether students are trying to explore for the possible solutions of a problem and are 
looking for the best one. 
c. The extent of the participation of the students in group discussions, problem solving and 
their communication skills during these exercises. 
d. How students are trying to solve the problem through various ways and are using 
appropriate methods for doing this. 
e. Assessment in groups, peer assessment and opportunities for self-assessment also help in 
self-correction. Teacher should collect information and evidence through different sources, 
methods and techniques, record of information or evidence and make sense of collected 
information or evidence and share and communicate feedback. 
3.8.1.2 
Middle Stage
The assessment of students may focus on key capabilities so that they may– 
a. Apply mathematical facts, generalise, and provide reason for it. 
b. Argue logically the truth and falsity of statements.
c. Understand the basic structure of different branches of mathematics such as number and 
operations, algebra, geometry, probability and statistics, measurement and mensuration.
d. Understand and apply different ways of dealing with and handling abstractions. 
e. Apply mathematical concepts learnt to solve problems in newer contexts.
207
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
It is important to note that prior thinking by Teacher on what is expected to be learnt from a 
lesson/unit is extremely important. For example, Teacher wants to assess the understanding 
about the area and perimeter of geometrical shapes, especially rectangle. Teacher may give some 
tasks to the students to do in the groups and observe groups and notes down about their func-
tioning on the following aspects: (a) Discussion within the group regarding the task; (b) Decision 
making about how to do the task; (c) Strategy/strategies for finding out various possibilities; (d) 
On the aspect of peer learning (learning from each other) (e) On the functioning of the group-com-
ing to a decision, working together & helping each other. 
After the group work, Teacher may ask a few questions and assess students on the basis of their 
responses. Teacher may also provide opportunities for self and peer assessment as well. 
3.8.1.3 
Secondary Stage
All projects and assignments should be done as group activities within the class and school time 
only. The other modes of assessment could be a part of classroom interactive activities. 
Tasks for problem solving, Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQ), data handling and analysis, inves-
tigative projects, math lab activities, models including origami, etc., research projects and pre-
sentations, group projects, peer assessment, presentations including the use of Information and 
Communication Technology (ICT) may help for the formative assessment in mathematics. 
3.8.2 Summative Assessment 
After completion of each unit/theme, Teacher will assess the students keeping in view the indi-
cators of learning related to that unit/theme. After a quarter, such data will provide the compre-
hensive picture of student’s performance in mathematics. The cumulative record of the progress 
of the student would help to get an overall view. By using different teaching-learning strategies, 
Teacher can assess various other aspects of student’s behaviour (concern for others, teamwork, 
etc.). This progress made by the students can be communicated to their parents along with the 
records of their progress. This data will provide a comprehensive picture of student’s progress 
in a holistic manner.
All across the schools, the most commonly used tools/techniques are those developed by teach-
ers themselves. Among these are paper-pencil tests and tasks, written and oral tests, questions 
on pictures, simulated activities, and discussion with students. Short class tests are used by most 
teachers as a quick and easy way of assessing the learning progress of students. As these are 
generally conducted at the end of a unit/month covering the specified content taught during that 
period, though these are important, they need to be used effectively. Every item in the test, should 
contribute to establishing and understanding where students are in the aspect of learning in fo-
cus – that is, every item should contribute to the purpose of the assessment. Questions/tasks/
activities/projects for assessment should be based on Competencies. More items on higher-or-
der thinking (creating, evaluating, analysing, applying, and understanding) in assessment may 
help to achieve Competencies and will take the shift away from mechanical and rote memorisa-
tion of the facts.
Stage wise suggestive tools and techniques for assessment may be as follows -
a. Preparatory Stage - Oral questions, Question Paper, Assignment, Project, Diagnostic test, 
Self-evaluation 
208
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
b. Middle Stage - Oral questions, Question Paper, Assignment, Project, Diagnostic test, Self 
– Evaluation, Activity/experiment, Peer Evaluation, Maths lab activities
c. Secondary Stage - Questions, Observation, Tests and inventories, Checklist, Rating scale, 
Anecdotal records, Document analysis, Portfolio, Assignments, Projects, Group discussions, 
Maths Club activities.
For recording and reporting student’s performance, following points of concern may be kept in 
focus: 
a. All the evidence collected through the use of various techniques - written, oral, activity, 
project or assignment-based; may be given weightage. 
b. Effort should be to report the student’s strengths in the areas in which he/she is making 
progress. 
c. Merely offering grades to students is not sufficient, it should be followed by providing 
qualitative remarks about the strengths/learning gaps, covering other aspects of student’s 
behaviour (personal-social qualities). 
At Preparatory and Middle Stages summative assessment may be done on monthly basis and this 
should include activities, oral and written work. Grade wise and Stage-wise progress can be re-
corded by compiling the performances in all monthly assessments. For Secondary Stage, there 
may be quarterly assessments (oral, written, activity, projects etc.) with a weightage of 80% to 
written and 20% to practicum/projects, and similarly for assessment at the end of the year. 
Grade wise and Stage wise result should be cumulative of performances in quarterly assess-
ments that would help to reduce the pressure of board exams and would lend importance to the 
progress throughout the year.

Assessment: Percentages
While teaching percentage in my class, I posed some questions to the students. Usually, we 
give questions from the textbook and the learners are able to solve them. But I feel that it 
doesn’t suffice for a complete understanding of the concepts because the exercise items are 
far removed from real life and practical situations where the children actually apply their 
experiences. So, I assigned them some tasks so that I can understand if the students are able 
to connect the concept of percentage to their real-life. This involved splitting the students to 
two groups. One of the groups was assigned a task to look at newspapers and collect clip-
pings of news-items wherever there is a number in percentage. The other group was as-
signed to collect pamphlets or click photographs of banners around shops that showed 
percentage, for instance, the discount offers. This involved children’s efforts to understand 
where they could find percentage and what it could have meant. When both the groups 
brought back the clippings, pamphlets, or photographs, we sat in the whole class-group 
where they shared their understanding. For instance, the clippings or snips read ‘Moist and 
damp town: Humidity at highest in fifteen years for September at 98%’, ‘Voter turn-out 
stands at 58%- lower than usual trend for the state’, ‘15% off as Raksha Bandhan offer’ etc. 
Students were then asked what do they think it meant and how do we calculate it, like how 
209
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
many people have voted, or how much would some article cost under 15% off offer. Further, 
students were asked questions such as which shop was offering the best discount or which 
brand is having the most variety of offers, etc. During this exercise, students asked questions 
when they encountered new terms such as inflation or humidity. Interestingly, students 
noticed percentage at other places and shared in the class such as when they play video 
games and mission completion percent is shown or when they open e-commerce websites 
such as Amazon or Flipkart.

Science Education
Science is a dynamic body of knowledge that enables an understanding of the world around us 
through a process of inquiry. This process leads to acquisition of valid knowledge about the 
world, and of scientific values and capacities, such as formulating questions and hypotheses, in-
quiry, evidence-based thinking, creativity, understanding cause and effect relationships, and de-
cision making. 
In the school curriculum, children start learning the processes of science from the Foundational 
Stage itself. In the Preparatory Stage, they continue learning the processes of science, and ob-
serve simple patterns and relationships in their natural environment. This lays the basis for con-
cepts related to science. Science is introduced as a separate curricular area only in the Middle 
Stage. In this Stage, the approach integrates Biology, Chemistry and Physics. This integrated ap-
proach develops fundamental capacities related to all disciplines, while using connections across 
disciplinary areas to help students make sense of their observations and experiences,  
212
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
The integrated approach continues in the first two years of the Secondary Stage (Grades 9 and 
10). In the next two years (Grades 11 and 12), a disciplinary approach is taken, with Physics, 
Chemistry and Biology being offered separately. Students get the opportunity to understand the 
nature of each discipline more deeply and develop specific competencies related to each. They 
also get the opportunity to explore their interest in taking the discipline up for further study.
At all Stages, along with conceptual understanding, the process capacities of science are devel-
oped with increasing complexity, as the methods are learnt. Students would understand the 
world around them with increasing depth and would also be able to explore scientific questions 
at different levels, across the stages. They are able to strengthen the understanding acquired at 
earlier stages, and also learn to communicate this understanding in different ways.  Connections 
with other curricular areas are also emphasised.

 Aims
Science develops a valid understanding of the physical world, and develops other important ca-
pacities, along with values and dispositions. This in turn enables the meaningful participation of 
individuals in society and the world of work with scientific temper, critical and evidence-based 
thinking, asking fundamental questions, analysing practices and norms, and acting for necessary 
changes. 
The world itself is undergoing rapid changes, and human beings need to adapt to these changes 
effectively, while also being the creators of change. It is this dynamic in which science contributes 
to societal, human, technological, and economic development through new knowledge and inno-
vation. 
With this context, the aims of science education are:
a. Developing understanding of scientific knowledge: Students develop an understanding 
of the concepts, principles, laws, and theories, and process capacities of science in keeping 
with their developmental stage. They use this understanding to explore and make sense of 
the world independently and in collaboration with peers. 
b. Developing the ability to use the scientific method: Students develop the ability to put 
forth arguments, predict, analyse, draw logical conclusions, take decisions and evaluate 
situations using the scientific method. 
c. Developing an understanding of how scientific knowledge evolves: Students develop a 
historical and developmental perspective of science. They understand that scientific knowl-
edge developed as a result of the efforts of many individuals across many years. They also 
understand how the methods of science evolved over time.
d. Developing an understanding of the connection between science and other curricular 
areas: Students view science as part of a larger canvas of disciplines. They become aware of 
interlinkages across disciplines. They understand that concepts, principles, laws and 
theories cannot be viewed as isolated parts, but together contribute to a holistic under-
standing of the world. 
e. Developing an understanding of the relationship between science, technology, and 
society: Students appreciate the contribution of science to society, and how different 
societal needs led to the generation of scientific knowledge. They develop an understanding 
of issues related to connections between science, technology, and society, including the 
ethical aspects and implications. 
f. Developing a scientific temper: Students develop critical and evidence-based thinking, 
and freedom from fear and prejudice. They develop curiosity, a sense of aesthetics, and 
creativity in science. They imbibe scientific values and dispositions – honesty, integrity, 
scepticism, objectivity, tenacity, perseverance, collaboration and cooperation, concern for 
life, preservation of the environment.

Section 4.2 
Nature of Knowledge
Science is an organized system of knowledge, which evolved as a result of curiosity, inquiry, log-
ical reasoning, experimentation, and examination of empirical evidence. It enables an under-
standing of the physical and biological environments and phenomena, identification of meaning-
ful patterns and relations, including cause(s) and effect(s), and supports the development of 
conceptual models and theories, laws, and principles.  
a. Science provides the methods and necessary tools to explore and understand the 
world. These methods and tools lead to explanations supported by empirical evidence that 
can be tested in a variety of diverse real-life situations against rigorous criteria (observa-
tion, rational argument, inference, replicability).  
b. Scientific knowledge keeps evolving – this is reflected in its history. Scientific knowledge is 
both reliable and subject to change. Having confidence in scientific knowledge is justified, 
while also realizing that such knowledge may be changed or modified based on new evi-
dence, or a re-conceptualization of prior evidence and knowledge. Science, therefore, 
develops an appreciation for change, as well as the rigorous process through which scientif-
ic knowledge changes. 
c. Science is fundamentally a creative endeavour. It involves imagination of different possibili-
ties – new ideas, alternatives, and possibilities to understand the world. It requires imagina-
tion to engage with the concepts of science – natural selection to explain diversity, plane-
tary models to represent motion of planets, ‘see’ the microscopic world beyond our capacity 
for observation. Model making, and design of experimental setups also require creativity. 
d. Scientific methods, and values and dispositions are integral not only to the learning and 
doing of science, but also in all walks of life. They offer individuals a framework with which 
to engage with their activities, and to base their decisions.

Section 4.3 
Subject-Specific Challenges
A major challenge related to science in the school curriculum is neglect of the development of 
conceptual understanding and the process capacities of doing science. 
a. Science teaching-learning is mostly based on the textbook, with the focus on facts and 
definitions. One reason for this is the curricular load, which reduces the time available for 
exploration and discussion. The development of conceptual understanding and process 
capacities requires time, which is currently missing. The process of inquiry, central to 
learning science, requires some flexibility with respect to time. However, schools have a 
rigid timetable. 
b. Another challenge is the disconnect between what students observe and experience 
outside school, and the school curriculum. Students come to school with their own 
theories about the world around them. These theories develop as they observe the world 
around them and seek explanations for what they see. Often, these theories conflict with 
what is being discussed in the classroom. Their existing notions do not get addressed in the 
classroom, and there is a separation between ‘home’ and ‘school’ science. 
c. As students move to higher grades, the demands on them increase, and the curricular load 
becomes greater. The need for abstract thinking also increases. It is critical that the stu-
dents develop the capacities to be able to make the progression. However, the current focus 
on facts does not build these capacities. Also, the time for understanding each concept is 
limited, so alternative conceptions may develop that are difficult to address.Even when 
events like science fest, Baal vaigyanik, science exhibitions, etc are organized, the focus is 
on theoretical understanding rather than problem solving or discovery.
d. While lack of infrastructure is common across curricular areas, learning science especially 
requires access to apparatus, equipment, and laboratories. Unfortunately, this is a neglected 
area. Low cost, easily available materials are also not used since Teachers lack the capacity 
to identify what is needed and how to develop it. At the Secondary Stage, access to a labora-
tory is non-negotiable – students must be able to manipulate apparatus, use materials and 
design simple experiments to truly develop important competencies related to science.

Learning Standards
4.4.1  Stagewise Curricular Goals and Competencies
Students start observing their environment and playing with objects around them in the Foun-
dational Stage itself. This exploration continues in the Preparatory Stage. The focus at this stage 
is on the immediate environment of students, with the interdisciplinary approach in the curric-
ulum reflecting the lives of children. The necessary competencies for learning science in the 
Middle Stage are developed in the Preparatory Stage through the interdisciplinary area ‘World 
Around Us’. 
Science is introduced as a separate curricular area in the Middle Stage and continues in the Sec-
ondary Stage. This chapter deals with the separate curricular area of science. Therefore, this 
section deals with the Curricular Goals and Competencies of Science in the Middle and Second-
ary Stages only.

4.4.2 Rationale for Selection of Essential Concepts
There is a general agreement that processes of science are equally important to learn as the con-
cepts. But usually this does not seem to get translated into our classrooms. There is a tendency 
to treat science as merely a ‘bunch of facts’. This approach assumes that there are certain con-
cepts, theories, facts, and information that students must know, and that they have knowledge of 
science. However, the knowledge base of science known today is vast and continues to grow at 
an unprecedented rate.  This implies that no matter how much ‘facts of science’ we learn, it will 
never be enough. 
The question that this throws up is –are there essential concepts that students must learn in 
science at the school level? 
Even though it would be clear that this not complete ‘knowledge of science’, this ‘essential set’ 
could be decided based on three criteria:
a. It provides adequate knowledge of the world for that age group
b. It provides the base and platform for learning science further 
c. It provides adequate ‘material’ for developing the capacities and values related to science 
education 
In addition, whatever concepts are chosen should be interesting, challenging, and intelligible for 
young minds. 
The Learning Standards must make a judicious choice of content on the basis of these principles 
to reduce the ‘content load’ on the students. 
This section provides the rationale that has guided the selection of essential concepts to frame 
the learning standards. Common considerations that have guided the selection of concepts 
across the Middle Stage, and Grades 9 and 10 are: (i) alignment with the developmental stages of 
students; (ii) ensuring sufficient time for inquiry and development of process capacities; and (iii) 
alignment with real life.
Curricular Goals at the Middle Stage are based on the concrete experiences of students. They are 
based on how the science curriculum can respond to the following questions:  
a. What do students see around them? 
b. What are the common observations they make? 
c. What are the aspects of science and technology that are part of their daily lives? 
d. What are their immediate concerns related to their own selves? 
e. How can they start making sense of multiple aspects of their environment – how can they 
start learning to abstract ‘science’ as the explanation of their observations and experiences? 
f. How do students learn best – what capacities enable them to learn at this stage? 
g. And most importantly, how will their learning of science help them in their daily life?
Curricular Goals at the Secondary Stage move from the concrete nature of the Middle Stage to-
wards abstraction. This abstraction could be in the nature of exploring what cannot be seen or in 
terms of more abstract representations (e.g. using a circuit diagram instead of drawing the com-
ponents of a circuit). They help students extend their understanding with increasing complexity 
225
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
and abstraction. The effort is to continue with the concepts discussed in the Middle Stage; a few 
new concepts are also introduced. The questions the curriculum must respond to at this Stage 
are: 
a. Is there something happening around us that we cannot directly observe? 
b. Why do events and phenomenon repeat themselves – what are the general principles that 
govern the world? 
c. What are the reasons for diversity around? 
d. What is the role of science and technology in society? 
e. What is the contribution of India to scientific knowledge? 
f. How can science be applied in other areas? 
g. What are the connections of other areas to science? 
h. How should science be practised?
The responses to these questions at both Stages require an identification of essential concepts 
that will enable students to attain the Curricular Goals and develop the capacity to explore fur-
ther on their own. They must be able to use their understanding of these concepts to explore 
other concepts they may not have formally engaged with. The matter of process capacities and 
communication of scientific questions and ideas is much simpler – there is clear agreement on 
the process capacities and competencies related to communication to be developed at each 
Stage.
4.4.2.1 
Middle Stage
Essential concepts that are part of the Learning Standards for this Stage are chosen based on the 
following rationale. 
a. Relate to the students’ observations of their immediate environment, from a small 
scale to a large scale – characteristics of matter, changes in matter, diversity of living 
things, and the night sky.  
Understanding these concepts enables them to further explore the material and living 
world. For example, they may develop an interest in astronomy through this introduction 
and be able to pursue it as a hobby. They will be able to independently understand different 
aspects of biodiversity. They will be able to apply their understanding of matter to other 
important events and phenomenon, such as the reason for loss of aquatic life due to chang-
es in temperature.
b. Help students find scientific explanations for a variety of commonly observed and 
experienced phenomena – effect of differences in pressure, temperature and density, 
magnets, path of light and how it changes as it reflects from different surfaces.  
Understanding these concepts enables them to apply scientific concepts to understand 
other phenomena, and activities in real life. For example, understanding the formation of 
winds will help them understand the formation of cyclones.
226
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
c. Help students see differences and relationships between different parts of their 
environment – characteristics of living and non-living things, relationship between living 
organisms and their environment. For example, they will understand the importance of 
environmental factors in different ecosystems, and how any change in the ecosystem has 
far-reaching effects. They will be able to understand how the effect of introducing chemicals 
in farming. 
d. Help students engage with common experiences, and ‘see’ them through the lens of 
science – one-dimensional motion, simple circuits, heating and magnetic effects of electric-
ity, particulate nature of matter and change, measurement and measuring physical proper-
ties of matter.  
They will be able to understand that there is a need to go beyond the obvious, and to 
represent what they see in simpler terms than is possible in real life. This further enables 
them to move towards abstraction and to be able to represent their understanding dia-
grammatically and mathematically. Understanding these concepts enables them to inde-
pendently extend their understanding and capacities for representation. For example, they 
will be able to understand how the electric bell at home rings. They will be able to discuss 
the motion of vehicles using scientific vocabulary. They will be able to communicate more 
complex ideas, which may or may not be related to science, visually or mathematically.
e. Help students engage with aspects of their daily life that are of immediate interest 
and concern – nutrition-based analysis of food they eat, diversity in food, biological chang-
es in their body and overall well-being, substance abuse, role of science and technology in 
improving their lives.  
They will be able to apply this understanding to explore aspects of health, hygiene and 
well-being independently. For example, they will be able to make informed choices about 
food, they are able to rationalise why to do something or not basis an informed understand-
ing. 
f. Help students engage with the nature and processes of science – while all the concepts 
will enable this, tracing the evolution of scientific knowledge, and taking up questions for 
inquiry will help bring focus to these aspects. They will be able to apply their understand-
ing of the scientific method to other subjects, and to independently conducting inquiry in all 
aspects of life.
g. Help students develop values and dispositions which will enable them to make deci-
sions in their daily lives as well as participate in larger society. 
4.4.2.2 
Secondary Stage
Essential concepts that are part of the Learning Standards for the Secondary Stage are chosen 
based on the following rationale. 
a. Help students to develop foundations of key ideas in science that have wider 
application – origin, properties and propagation of sound introduces students to the idea 
of waves. 
These concepts are useful not only in understanding more advanced concepts in science but 
also to understand real life applications. For example, like how television, echo, sonar, 
musical instruments work.
227
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
b. Help students to explain processes and materials around them in scientific 
terms – application of concepts related to electricity to home, nature and properties of 
chemical substances used in daily life, work and energy, principle of mechanical advantage.  
Understanding these concepts enables them to evolve their scientific vocabulary and 
explore how the things that make our lives convenient work. For example, understanding 
the principle of mechanical advantage and applying it to systems of levers and pulleys will 
help students to not only make simple tasks easier but also to understand the working of 
more complex machines like elevators. They also understand the difference between 
common usage of terms like work and energy, and scientific explanations. 
c. Help students to engage with what they cannot ‘see’ to provide explanations for what 
they can observe – atomic structure and valency, formations of compounds, cellular 
processes, life processes, diversity, cellular mechanisms of heredity, and natural selection.  
Understanding these concepts enables them to appreciate the existence of the microscopic 
and atomic world, and how these impact our lives. 
d. Help students to see patterns in the world and to organise them to form 
generalisations – periodic table, linkage between the universal law of gravitation and laws 
of motion, classification of living organisms, biological organisation at different levels and 
interactions.
e. Help students to identify and manipulate variables to develop causal 
relationships – manipulation of object and lenses and image characteristics, and manipu-
lation of characteristics of a circuit.  
These concepts enable students to ‘play’ with variables and objects, developing their 
powers of reasoning and creativity. They help students see the beauty of science as not a 
collection of facts but as a process of doing and evidence-based thinking.
f. Help students to represent the world in scientific terms, draw inferences, and make 
predictions – representation of simple chemical interactions and changes, graphical and 
mathematical representation of motion, ray diagrams and building working models.
g. Help students formalise their observations and understanding in the form of gener-
alisation and mathematisation – relationship between mass and weight using the univer-
sal law of gravitation, relationship between kinetic and potential energy, Newton’s laws, 
Ohm’s laws, and Mendel’s laws of inheritance.  
These concepts enable students to apply and derive scientific laws, and how they lead to a 
simplified understanding of complex realities. 
h. Help students to understand the contribution of India to the world’s scientific 
knowledge – indigenous practices related to health and medicinal herbs, empirical evi-
dence used in Indian medical practices and development of ideas around astronomy in 
India.  
These concepts, along with contribution of Indian thought to scientific ideas, enable stu-
dents to develop an appreciation for the scientific knowledge available in our country. 
Students will be motivated to explore more of what is available locally and in our ancient 
texts.

i. Help students to develop a multidisciplinary understanding of science, and its linkag-
es with other curricular areas. Students use their understanding from other curricular 
areas to support science learning and apply scientific ideas to other areas. This enables 
them to understand the connections of science with other curricular areas, as well as with 
life. 
j. Students’ understanding of the nature and processes of science is deepened at this 
Stage by engaging with the science curriculum. They are enabled to conduct scientific 
inquiry independently and connect their findings to their understanding of scientific 
concepts, laws, and principles. They will be able to communicate their findings in different 
modes with accuracy and creativity.

Section 4.5 
Principles of Content Selection
Concepts by themselves are abstract. They need to be presented to students though content that 
helps them connect the concept with their previous knowledge as well as with their observa-
tions and experiences in the real world. For example, simply stating the rectilinear propagation 
of light is insufficient. This concept must be demonstrated to students, or they should be able to 
conclude that light travels in a straight light through observation or manipulation. Without suit-
able content, we reduce science to mere facts. To extend the example of rectilinear propagation 
of light, students can observe this through the formation of shadows, or the simple manipulation 
of cardboard sheets with small holes in front of a candle, or using a pinhole camera/periscope 
made in the classroom. Thus, content is extremely important, and must be selected carefully. 
This selection of content must be guided by following considerations: 
a. Content across all stages must foster scientific inquiry with increasing complexity of what 
students are able to do. For example, observation should progress from ‘seeing’ in the 
Foundational Stage, to observation at the Preparatory Stage, to simple manipulation in 
order to observe changes in the Middle Stage, to the manipulation of variables at the 
Secondary Stage.
b. Existing assessment structure tends to assess recall of the facts of science rather than the 
ability to use to processes of science. Content should provide enough opportunities to 
comprehensively assess the process capacities at the respective stage.
With the above in mind, the principles for content selection are:
a. Content should be connected to the students’ lives and surroundings to the maximum 
possible extent.  
A student in Andaman and Nicobar Islands and a student in Jharkhand will observe differ-
ent kinds of plants and animals around them. But they should also understand the role of 
environmental factors. This generalization will require them to understand environments 
they may not have experienced as well as some abstract ideas (e.g., temperature, precipita-
tion). 
Light and its use is also all around us – we use mirrors, we see rainbows, we see the sun and 
other sources of light. light reflects off different surfaces in different ways. When we see 
objects in water, they get distorted. Content must encourage students to question and 
inquire about these phenomena, that will lead them to explore scientific ideas related to 
light. Thus, they will engage with a critical area that shows the progression of concepts 
(from the representation of the behaviour of light through a simple ray diagram in the 
Middle Stage to representation of the behaviour of plane waves in the Secondary Stage) as 
well as the advance of science and technology (from the transition of night-to-day to the use 
of lenses and mirrors, to optic fibres to observatories). 
b. Content should enable progression of concepts and build complexity across stages.    
For example, students observe sunrise and sunset, and connect it to-day and night in the 
Foundational Stage. In the Preparatory Stage, they observe the night sky, connect direction 
with the setting of the sun and moon, observe sunset and sunrise at different times of the 
230
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
year, share their observations on the brightness of the sun, and moon. In the Middle Stage, 
they understand what distinguishes different celestial bodies, our place in the universe, 
what holds solar systems and galaxies together, and how technological advances in satel-
lites make lives easier on earth. At this stage, a simple telescope can be used to help stu-
dents observe the night sky and distinguish between celestial objects. In Grades 9 and 10, 
they learn about the forces in play in the universe and how they impact celestial bodies 
(shape of celestial bodies). 
c. Content should provide opportunities to actively engage in the process of scientific 
inquiry as relevant for the stage.
For example, in the earlier stages, students explore ideas of floating and sinking by making 
simple observations of different objects and making inferences about common properties. 
In the middle stage, students identify and measure the physical properties, and determine 
mathematical relationship between physical properties (e.g., relationship between mass, 
volume, and density and how this relates to floatation). They understand the concepts and 
represent diagrammatically the states of float and sink.  They measure displacement of 
liquid and relate it to density. They may design simple experimental designs (e.g., clay boat 
of different shapes, weight) using instruments for measurement (measuring jar and over-
flow jar). Given data about density of liquids, they make predictions about the state of float 
and sink of objects in them (relative density). They communicate their inferences in differ-
ent modes (oral, mathematical diagrammatic, in words). Thus, from verifying similar 
properties at earlier stages they progress to making quantitative predictions and measure-
ments to arrive at theories about floatation.  At the secondary stage, they can arrive at the 
conclusion that the density of water is 1 and the engage with the idea of buoyancy through 
quantitative measurements.  
In this approach, students are active participants in the learning process as opposed to 
passive receivers of information.
d. Content should allow a comprehensive assessment of process capacities at each 
stage.
Content must be chosen to allow students to use the range of process capacities in an 
observable manner so that teachers can assess process capacities explicitly. This is aligned 
with the approach of defining competencies related to process capacities under separate 
goals. Assessment data must reflect the goals and competencies of the science curriculum 
as well. Student achievement related to process capacities should be represented explicitly.  
This means making a choice between presentation of a concept versus ensuring students 
‘do’ something to attain the understanding of the concept. On the other hand, content can 
offer tasks (e.g., activity, experiment, writing task) that are observable, and provide scope 
for interpretation and understanding of students. For example, the effect on time period of 
the pendulum of changing the length of the thread and mass of a simple pendulum can be 
discussed through a description and presentation on the blackboard/textbook. On the other 
hand, students can make simple pendulums using different easily available materials and 
record their observations. Their conclusion may not be entirely perfect compared to a 
well-designed pendulum, but they can draw inferences, which lead to constructing theory 
231
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
(e.g., relationship between mass and length of thread, and time period). The content select-
ed changes from ‘time period of simple pendulum’ to ‘investigating factors affecting time 
period of simple pendulum’ 
Content of this nature allows the student to reflect on the process, enabling self-reflection. 
If the experiment is not proceeding well (e.g., the bob swings wildly), the student must 
examine what needs to be done. This is relevant for each stage and ensures progression of 
attainment of the process capacities across stages. This process also enables students to 
take up collaborative as well as independent study as stages progress.  
e. Content should enable an adequate sense of achievement at each stage – while con-
cepts become complex across stages, milestones can be defined for subsidiary con-
cepts that are complete and whole.
For example, we introduce students to plane mirrors, then spherical mirrors, and then 
lenses and system of lenses. They move from understanding reflection and image character-
istics at each stage in a complete manner.  
Similarly, in the preparatory and early middle stage observing diversity of living organisms 
around and classifying them based on the observable characteristics at earlier stages allows 
students to make sense of living world around. In the later part of middle stage and the 
secondary stage, when microscopes are introduced, they make observations of living 
organisms, and their cellular organization allows student to re-classify or comprehend 
other ways of classifications of organisms based on the nature of cellular organization such 
as five kingdom system. At each stage, different scales of complexities of living organisms 
are observed and understood. Thus, at each stage, the criteria for classification are valid 
while providing scope for expanding these criteria with newer concepts.
f. Content should provide opportunities for students to engage in extended durations 
of inquiry.
Content should lead to extended, long-term inquiry beyond the classroom engagement. This 
can be in the form of long-term projects like documenting the cycle of food production over 
a season. It can also be a recording of simple observations over a period of a month or so to 
understand a concept better, such as drawing the phases of the moon on a classroom 
calendar. Or it can be a short observation like fermentation by yeast to make bread. Stu-
dents could monitor the life cycle of mosquitoes, butterflies, or moths; they could also grow 
fruit flies to observe organisms around them. Long term projects that allow students to 
learn from deeper engagement with content they learn in the classroom. For example, 
growing food and using that process of farm work to inform learning of scientific ideas and 
processes. This encourages students to go into the depth and breadth of concept. It also 
connects concepts to real life.
g. Content should cater to the diverse needs of students. 
Content should cover a range of concepts that are interesting for all students. They must 
have opportunities to engage with the concept in different ways. For example, if a student is 
struggling to represent a concept in mathematical terms, they can start with representation 
232
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
through a simple working model, diagram or a verbal description, and progress from there.
Students with disabilities should be included in the process of learning as far as possible. In 
this context, a range of materials and technology (simulation, audio-video resources) is 
necessary. For example, a force diagram can be made using tactile materials, detailed 
descriptions of the force diagram can be made available, etc. 
h. Content must develop the ability to use the language of science.
Communicating scientific ideas is critical – for this, both representation of the world as well 
as the development of a scientific vocabulary are critical. While the development of the 
scientific vocabulary progresses as engagement with scientific ideas increases, content 
must enable representation of natural phenomenon – from simple diagrammatic represen-
tations (evaporation, solar system, structure of plants) to more complex representations 
(atomic structure, structure of cell) and abstractions that make understanding easy (forces 
acting on a body) to mathematical representations (laws of motion, vectors, use of trigo-
nometry and calculus to further break down abstractions to calculate magnitude of vari-
ables and make predictions).
i. Content should prepare students to engage with life as responsible member of the 
community, as well as a career in scientific professions.  
Using available scientific evidence to make decisions and guide choices people make should 
be enabled by the science education at the school level such as decisions to vaccinate 
oneself, making healthier eating choices, examine media claims critically or contributing to 
inclusive society by critically examining one’s belief and so on. Science content can help 
students make informed decisions about one’s career (teacher, doctor, engineer, technician, 
bureaucrats and so on) that directly apply or build upon capacities and capabilities devel-
oped during school education. 
j. Content should enable students to examine and practice scientific values and other 
values in the NEP 2020. 
Content must also demonstrate scientific values (integrity, honesty, transparency, pluralism, 
looking at information in an unbiased manner; objectivity; acceptance for heterogeneous 
and alternative views) and enable processes that will help individual take position on 
societal issues.  
For example, examining how the geocentric conceptualization of the universe shifted to the 
heliocentric conceptualization (established beliefs), and observations of the orbit of Pluto 
being classified as a dwarf planet (Middle Stage and Grades 9 and 10). The journey of these 
scientific ideas reflects the changing nature of scientific theories and the tenacity of scien-
tists. 
Also, studying heredity, evolution and biological diversity can lend themselves to an exam-
ination of how long-held beliefs were challenged by science based on evidence and how it is 
often presented – the superiority of humans (anthropocentricism); assumptions of superi-
ority of certain races; how every life matters for the symbiotic existence of every other life; 
similarity of the origins and beginning of life despite later diversity of physical characteris-
tics.
233
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
k. Content must enable integration across and within curricular areas.
Learning of science can be enhanced through integration of other curricular areas. For 
example, playing with different musical instruments allows children to understand frequen-
cy and amplitude. Games allow students to develop concepts related to motion; examining 
play on the moon helps them engage with concepts of gravity and force. The use of muscles 
while playing, stretching, etc. are related to physical education – which muscles are used, 
their use in the body. 
234

Section 4.6 
Pedagogy
Learning science involves not just learning theories and facts of science, but also making connec-
tions between conceptual learning and real life, acquiring the process capacities of science, and 
most importantly, applying these to understanding the world.  
Students like to explore the world around them and understand why and how things happen. In 
this process of exploration, they use trial and error methods to test their hypothesis and reach a 
possible conclusion. This exploration need not take place individually – children learn science 
best through engaging with peers and adults.
Students have theories about why things happen, patterns they see around them, about cause-
and-effect relationships.  As they learn about science in a more formal set-up, these ideas get 
tested.  Some concepts fit into the students’ current understanding, while others require a shift 
in thinking. If there is alignment between current ideas and what is discussed in classrooms, 
ideas get strengthened.
At the same time, some concepts do not fit into the students’ current thinking. If not addressed, 
they can turn into alternative conceptions. For example, heavy objects fall faster, plants and seeds 
are non-living because they don’t move, or heavy/big objects always sink in water. If these ideas 
are not challenged and suitably modified through investigation, they can turn into alternative 
conceptions, which persist as students move through school. 
Apart from these theories, students also bring with them the ability to reason, understand, and 
explain relationships between cause and effect. These capacities serve as the basis for develop-
ing scientific reasoning. Opportunities, therefore, to inquire are important, as opposed to being 
‘told’. 
Scientific values, like honesty and integrity, also develop through ‘doing science’. For example, 
while demonstrating an experiment on the boiling point of water, we should write the reading on 
the thermometer accurately, even if water is not boiling at 100 degrees.
The role of the Teacher in aligning pedagogy and assessment to how children learn science is 
critical. Teachers must build an environment that promotes natural curiosity, encourages ques-
tions, gives maximum possible opportunities for hands-on activities, and space to discuss ideas. 
Opportunities to students to express their understanding through different modes, and forma-
tive assessments to track growing understanding are also key to learning science.
235

Teacher’s Voice B-4.6-i [to be edited]
Addressing alternate conceptions
As a teacher I have experienced students already have some ideas/theories constructed 
through their observations and social interactions   which are at times not in alignment 
with the accepted form of scientific knowledge. Hence, before beginning any concept I try to 
find out what and how students are thinking about the concept through some activities/
questions and work in a planned way to help students test and redefine their thinking in 
light of accepted scientific knowledge. 
For example, while teaching living-non-living I asked students to categorize listed things 
into living and non-living. Going through the responses I came across some students of my 
class struggled hard to accept seeds are living, they believed dry seeds are non-living and 
had rationale to explain the same (seeds do not move, it does not respire). Instead of directly 
enforcing them to accept that seeds are living, we conducted a few experiments to under-
stand if seeds respire (by preparing three jars, one containing dry seeds, one containing 
germinated seeds and third jar is kept empty as control, cotton dipped in phenolphthalein 
solution is kept hanging in the 3 jars and observed after an interval for colour change when 
it interacts with Carbon dioxide, given out by living things during respiration). It helped 
students to reconsider their belief and accept that even dry seeds are actually living. 
4.6.1 Pedagogic Principles
Science pedagogy across stages must be informed by the following principles: 
a. Learning science requires active engagement of students with the world around them to 
understand it. Science pedagogy achieves this through:
i. 
Simulating the processes of science such as asking questions, hypothesising, observing, 
testing, finding evidence, collecting data, analysing, modifying conclusions, 
communicating, and re-questioning. 
ii. Exposing students to a variety of aspects of learning science in varied settings – the 
laboratory, classroom, and field – through approaches such as inquiry, discovery, 
didactic, hands-on science.
iii. Encouraging and sustaining curiosity by providing varied experiences that may 
challenge students’ existing notions and ideas. 
b. Learning science requires communication and sharing of ideas and observations.  Science 
pedagogy achieves this through: 
i. 
Using scientific vocabulary in transaction and creating a variety of contexts and 
situations for students to communicate their understanding, ideas, observations.
ii. Peer and collaborative learning.
236
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
c. Learning science requires gradual increase in the capacity to engage with complex and 
abstract ideas, aligned with the cognitive and procedural capacities of students. Science 
pedagogy achieves this through building on children’s existing knowledge and using 
multiple representations (mathematical, graphical, diagrammatic, models). 
d. Learning science requires making linkages of knowledge for the holistic and 
multidisciplinary learning emphasized in the NEP 2020. Science pedagogy achieves this 
through:
i. 
Connecting scientific knowledge inside and outside the classroom.
ii.  Horizontal connections with other curricular areas.
e. Learning science enables development of certain values, such as collaboration, sensitivity, 
empathy, equality of opportunities, respect for diversity and other values mentioned in NEP 
2020. Science pedagogy must facilitate this process. 
f. Learning science must be done in a variety of settings – classroom, field and laboratory. An 
appropriate combination of approaches and settings can be used to teach a concept. The 
following is a non-comprehensive list of considerations on the basis of which Teachers can 
choose pedagogical approaches and settings: 
i. 
Nature of concept should guide decision regarding the approach and setting. For 
example, speed can be discussed in the play field, but structure of cell requires a 
microscope. 
ii. The approach and setting chosen should not affect the attainment of learning outcomes 
and competencies. 
iii. Each of recommended approaches and settings must be selected at least once in an 
academic year, if not more. This will ensure exposure to varied approaches and settings. 
iv. Even when Teachers choose a didactic approach, areas that students could have 
potentially inquired about or discovered should be highlighted. 
4.6.1.1 
Recommended Pedagogical Approaches and Settings
The same pedagogical approach can be used across the three settings most suitable for learning 
science – the classroom, the field, and the laboratory. This section details recommended peda-
gogical approaches across a variety of settings. 
a. Hands-on science:
The most important part of learning science is actually ‘doing science’ through hands-on 
experiential learning. ‘Doing science’ can range from trial and error, using materials around 
them, or using basic scientific instruments (measuring instruments), and laboratory appa-
ratus. In this process, students gain conceptual understanding and develop process capaci-
ties through manipulating, designing and building to. 
b. Discovery approach: 
Students explore the natural world following their own interests and discover patterns of 
how the world works during their explorations. Teachers may also create opportunities or 
draw attention to natural phenomena that students can explore further. Often, this discov-
ery is followed by other more structured approaches to ensure learning. For example, the 
237
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Teacher draws attention of the students to changes in the length of the shadows as the day 
progresses or to the venation patterns of the leaves of different plants. Students’ observa-
tions are then connected to scientific concepts such as the path of light, and the venation 
pattern is connected to the shapes of the leaves.
c. Inquiry approach:
Inquiry approach allows students to navigate through unknown questions, and to explore 
solutions by themselves. It allows students to work in the same way as scientists. Inquiry 
approach engages students with systematic observation, visualizing, experimenting, infer-
ring, communicating, discovering relations. This approach allows Teachers to choose the 
appropriate type of inquiry with respect to the concept, and to scaffold (support as per 
needs) students’ learning. For example, students could explore questions such as: How does 
the image characteristics vary with relative position between lens and object? How does the 
surface area of the reactants affect the rate of reaction? How does the intensity of light 
affect the rate of Photosynthesis? 
d. Project-centred approach:  
This approach allows learning within the classroom to continue outside the classroom, and 
to extend over a period of time. For example, observing the changes in moon over a month 
to understand the phases of moon. In this process, connections to daily life are also made. 
The project centred approach allows students to develop artefacts/products (charts, 
presentations, speech, etc.) that reflect and communicates their emerging understanding. It 
also allows integration of concepts across different curricular areas. For example, visits to 
the sites of local professional communities and interactions with the people engaged there 
such as potters, weavers, crafts persons, farmers, blacksmith, cobbler, butcher would enable 
integrating concepts from vocational education and art with science.
e. Didactic approach:
Often, teaching science involves communicating certain important information in the form 
scientific terms, phenomena, and historical development of concepts and ideas. In this 
approach, the teacher largely regulates the direction and flow of the lesson. For example, 
after students have discovered changes in the length of the shadows throughout a day, 
teacher can explain effect of position of the sun on the length of the shadow, and how 
students can use it to keep track of the time as well.
f. Demonstration:
Teacher demonstrates working of certain instruments or outcomes of experimental set-ups 
to draw attention of the students to relevant concepts. These demonstrations enrich stu-
dent learning experiences of the concepts.  
These approaches can be implemented in variety of settings as illustrated in the Table 
below. The Table illustrated how only a few competencies and related learning outcomes 
can be addressed. It is not comprehensive in terms of illustrated all possible combinations 
of pedagogical approaches and settings.

Physical and Chemical Changes
As a science teacher, I think it’s important to understand the value experimentation and 
discussion can add to learning of science in a student’s life. Experimentation must be under-
stood in a way that it is not something to be carried in class just to test and verify the 
science concepts mentioned in textbook but to examine and connect with the pre-knowl-
edge, opinions students already hold. 
For example- while working with physical and chemical changes in grade 7, I initiated the 
discussion for building the context of changes by asking them about the story of magic stick, 
that changes things it touches as per the desire of the person holding it. I asked one of the 
students to share the story. Further, I asked that if you suddenly get magic stick to change 
things around you, what are the things you would like to change? Students responded, my 
school bag, school dress, my toys, my home etc. Now I told without magic stick can we 
change things around us? Students shared some changes which they already observed in 
their surroundings and daily life like formation of curd from milk, cooking, boiling of water, 
ripening of fruits, decomposition of leaves, rusting of iron etc. Now I told them, various 
changes are taking place in our surrounding and daily life some of the changes involve 
formation of new substance while some do not (chemical and physical change).  
Next, I divided them into groups and asked them list and classify the changes which we 
discussed earlier as physical and chemical change. 
Now students performed experiments to verify their reasons for classification based on our 
earlier discussions on criteria for classification of changes.
Activity Sheet: 
After performing the experiments and drawing the conclusion, I asked groups to share their 
observation, results, and learnings with others. All groups shared their results, and I wrote 
all these in board and shared formation of new substance is fundamental criteria for 
chemical change. To assess their understanding, I asked the students to write two physical 
and two chemical changes from their daily life and mention the reason. I also provided an 
assessment sheet to analyse their understanding.

What floats and what sinks?
Material Required - 
Tumblers of Water, Alcohol/kerosene/petrol, and Sugar solution (250 ml each – per group) 
Cork, eraser, plastic straw, betel seed, metal paperclip, candle piece, cut pencil piece, Clay, 
Carrot & potato pieces  
The students are asked to guess first as to whether a particular object would float or sink in 
each of the given liquids based on either the previous experience or the assumption based on 
their understanding. They are given the below observation table printed in a sheet. First, 
they are put in about five or six groups and each group contains 4 to 5 children. Objects are 
given to the students. They write the names of all the objects given against each liquid and 
they fill the third column with educated guesswork. Then they are asked to test their predic-
tions by dropping the object into the liquids given to them. While doing so, students are also 
asked to look for any pattern, if they can see any.
 
When the students come back to a large group to discuss their predictions and 
what happened actually, the Teacher writes the various responses from the stu-
dents in two columns in such a way that one column carries properties of liquid 
and the other carries the properties of the object. In case of lack of ideas from the 
students, the Teacher can use the following questions to elicit responses in line 
with the flow of the activities.  
a. Why do you think some objects floated and some did not? Why do you think this floated 
in sugar solution/salt solution and did not in water? 
b. Why does this object sink in all three liquids? Why does this object float in all three 
liquids? 
c. Why does any object that floats in alcohol, floats in water and Sugar/salt solution too? 
d. Why does any object that sink in sugar/salt solution sinks in alcohol and water too? 
e. This object did not float as you predicted. Can we work out why that is? Do you have a 
different view now?

f. This crushed Aluminium foil is floating in water.  Do you think you could find a way to 
make it sink? 
g. Do you think floating objects have anything in common? Why do you think the potato 
sinks while the apple floats? 
The questions of the above nature to be asked to students highlight sinking and floating 
depend upon properties of object as well as properties of liquid. This naturally warrants a 
situation to explore properties of object as well as liquid in which it is dropped. The ques-
tions for discussion can be used by the Teacher to assess the understanding of students 
(formative assessment during the activity). Questions also lead the discussion towards 
appreciation of fact that floatation depends on both the liquids and the objects. For exam-
ple, questions 3 and 4 steer the discussion towards this understanding. Later questions 
encourage students to examine their understanding. They help them try and find patterns in 
their observations.
4.6.1.2 
Horizontal Connections
a. Horizontal connections with other curricular areas are necessary for the holistic and 
multidisciplinary learning emphasized in the NEP 2020.  Some curricular goals and 
competencies in both the Middle and Secondary Stage are designed to ensure horizontal 
connections between science and other curricular areas. At the same time, pedagogy must 
be designed so that these connections are actually made in the classroom. 
b. Pedagogic approaches and methods such as inquiry and project by their nature provide 
scope to utilise concepts and process capacities that cut across the disciplines of science. 
For example, a project on investigating the sound produced by different musical 
instruments, and how this sound can be varied. Qualities and properties of sound produced 
both in terms of aesthetics, physics concepts involved, mathematical patterns and human 
perception lead to a holistic appreciation and integration of competencies across curricular 
areas.
c. Pedagogic methods like survey- and field-based methods enable students to see concepts 
through socio-cultural, economic, emotional, and scientific lenses.  For example, survey of 
traditional medicinal and cooking practices, and their connection with the seasons. 
4.6.2 Resources in Science Teaching
Science laboratories are essential for a good science education. However, there is currently no 
separate room for science laboratory in Middle schools, although science kits are provided. In 
this situation, Teachers can use their classrooms or any open space for performing experiments. 
The following must inform the use of resources: 
a. The materials and equipment should be simple and easy to use. This makes it more likely 
that they will be used in classrooms by Teachers. At the Middle Stage, science kits available 
at most schools provide a good start. 
243
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
b. However, students should not be restricted to the science kits. The more materials they use, 
the more opportunities they get to do science and hence, learn science. For example, 
improvised apparatus can be made using inexpensive materials to extend the use of 
materials beyond the science kit.

Making a Measuring Jar
Measuring jar is usually a part of every science kit. It 
can also be made from simple material available 
around. 
Material required: Syringes (10 ml), plastic measuring 
cups (of 5 ml) that are usually available with syrups (figure 1), a plain paper strip, and an 
empty transparent bottle (that can hold at least 100 ml, a thin bottle would serve the 
purpose better)
Procedure: 
a. Paste a thin strip of paper along the length of the bottle (1cm 
wide)
b. Fill the syringe/measuring cup to its full quantity (10 ml/5ml)
c. Pour it in the bottle.
d. Make a mark at the level of water. It is advisable to mark at the lower meniscus. (The 
dotted line in figure 1 is the lower meniscus)
e. Continue steps 2 to 4 till the expected measurement quantity is reached.
c. At this stage, if the school can provide dedicated lab space, with adequate space for simple 
materials and resources, it must be done.
d. At the same time, doing science must not be restricted to science laboratories or science 
kits. Classrooms, especially in the Middle Stage, must allow the doing of science. At the same 
time, all safety considerations must be kept in mind.
e. Tinkering laboratories – informal spaces where students can ‘play’ with simple scientific 
materials and equipment independently – can be set up in any room within the school. This 
will help students strengthen design thinking, creating and experimental capacities. 
Initially, students would have to be supported by the teacher. 
f. Students at the Secondary Stage would require standard scientific equipment and 
apparatus, and basic infrastructure, in which they perform experiments with convenience 
and safety. Therefore, Secondary schools should have well equipped, resourceful, and 
spacious science laboratory to conduct science experiments and investigations.

g. If a school has a laboratory, but the number of the students is large, the teacher can 
alternatively allow students to do the experiments in groups or ask students to perform the 
experiments on alternate days. 
h. Budgets for science in the Middle and Secondary Stages are limited, so science equipment 
and materials should be inexpensive. However, if the equipment is of inferior quality (e.g., 
weak magnet, cheap microscope with plastic lens), it may not be worth using.  
i. Alternatives can be used. For example, in case of unavailability of litmus paper, a teacher can 
use turmeric solution or turmeric paper strips for identifying the acidic and basic 
characteristics of the substances. For this, the Teacher will take turmeric (powder or solid) 
and add it in a paper or glass cup containing water. This solution can be used for 
identification of acids and bases. Teacher can also make wet paper strips dipped in turmeric 
solution. Students can be asked to do the following - Dry these paper strips, prepare 
solutions of each substance in water, dip the strip in the solution, and check the colour 
change of the turmeric paper strips. Could you make list of change in colours of these 
substances?
4.6.3 Classroom management
Classroom environment plays a vital role in student’s learning. An ideal classroom of science is 
one which has sufficient space and flexible seating to enable both small group work and whole 
class seating. Flexibility of the classroom is key in terms of allowing enough space to accommo-
date a wide range of activities.
The displays, charts and other teaching-learning material in the classroom should change and 
get renewed in sync with the concept being dealt in the classroom. Some storage space in the 
room makes it easier for the teacher to have materials handy. 
Classroom arrangement should complement instructional strategies – one way to ensure this is 
to have the same classroom for science lessons, with students coming to the room instead of the 
teacher going to the classroom. Having a dedicated science classroom for Middle and Secondary 
Stages will also help in managing the resources efficiently and reduce the operational load of the 
teacher. The burden of bringing materials together and ensuring they are replaced, arranging the 
classroom to enable students to work in groups, access to simple equipment that students may 
want to use (e.g., magnifying glass in a lesson on magnets in case students want to examine the 
surface of the magnets), and so on will be taken care of in case of a dedicated classroom.

Assessment in Science
4.7.1 Assessment Principles
The following principles must inform assessment in science across stages: 
a. Assessment in science includes assessment of conceptual understanding as well as process 
capacities. Process capacities, like any other skill set, need sustained nurturing and constant 
assessment. Observation, identification of areas of inquiry, formulating questions and 
hypotheses, data collation and analysis, prediction, and so on – the core capacities of doing 
science – must be assessed from the Foundational stage onwards.
b. Therefore, emphasis should be on the assessment of activities and experiments, as well as 
inferences drawn from them, rather than assessment of facts and information.
c. The following principles should inform formative assessment
i. 
Formative assessments help the Teacher understand alternative conceptions that 
students hold, and the extent to which they are interfering with learning. 
ii. This assessment is not for evaluation but to help Teachers align pedagogical strategies 
to students’ current understanding.
iii. Ongoing assessments will help the Teacher to track the alignment of students growing 
understanding to scientific concepts.
d. The following principles should inform formative assessment
i. 
Summative assessment must include assessment of process capacities.
ii. It should assess different cognitive levels – it should not be limited to recall of science 
facts.
e. Assessment in science could happen in different modes/settings – for example, formulating 
questions, participation in debates and discussions, developing models (including 
mathematical representations) to explain or demonstrate phenomenon, communicating 
understanding through written and other modes of expression, designing, and conducting 
experiments.

Assessment: Volume
Even though most of my Grade 7 students recall the mathematical calculations for calculat-
ing volume of regular geometric objects very accurately, I’m not very sure if they have really 
understood the meaning of it and see its connections with floating/sinking as well. I feel 
paper pencil test through questions cannot sufficiently address the assessment of such skills 
because just solving numerical by applying mathematical formula is not adequate to claim 
student have understood the concept and can apply the same in daily life situations. Hence, I 
was looking for tools/techniques that are valid and reliable to assess conceptual under-
standing where students get an opportunity to engage with meaningful activity to test if 
they can apply their understanding. I believe designing appropriate assessment tool/
technique is highly crucial to understand if students have really understood the concept. I 
decided to use investigation as an assessment tool to understand and extend students’ 
learning and move a step towards independent thinking and learning. There are three 
assessment tasks I used in my class: 
Task 1: I provide a table with data showing the volume measured and volume of water 
displaced for a small set of unknown objects. I ask students to make predictions if the object 
will sink or float based on this data. 
Task 2: I ask students to measure the volume of irregular objects such as stone, metal spoon 
etc. And report their findings. 
Task 3: I ask students to write a note if the same approach would work for other liquids and 
the same set of objects, for example, oil, medical spirit etc.  
I expected these three tasks would also help me identify levels of understanding of the 
students and I make changes in my plan for subsequent lessons.

4.7.3 Outcome of assessment – 
Given the importance of the processes of science in the science curriculum, a narrow view of the 
outcomes would fail to reflect the competencies included in science curricular area. The process 
of assessment leads to certain specific outcomes for students, teachers, head teachers, parents, 
and other stakeholders.
Student – For students, the outcomes should provide a clear view of the present learning across 
curricular goals and competencies.
Teacher – For of teacher, the outcomes should guide classroom practices, pedagogic choices to 
ensure attainment of competencies. This is particularly true for process capacities.
Head-teacher – For head-teachers, the outcomes should give comprehensive view of the aca-
demic health of the school across grades and stage levels with respect to science.

 Social Science
Social Science is a systemic study of human society and the relationship between the individual 
and society, social institutions, and organizations. It draws its content from the disciplines of 
History, Geography, Political Science, and Economics, to provide an interdisciplinary understand-
ing of society and its functions. At the heart of Social Science education lies an understanding of 
the world, the diverse concerns of human society, and participating in it as empathetic and re-
sponsible citizens. 
In the school curriculum, the study of Social Science starts in the Middle Stage. Students in this 
Stage will engage with various aspects of society through a thematic approach to Social Science 
learning. The themes will progress from the local to the regional, then to the national and the 
world. The students will engage in an empirical enquiry into content drawn from all four disci-
plines on various aspects of society in an integrated manner. At the Secondary Stage, students 
will develop a deep conceptual understanding of the four disciplines comprising Social Science. 
This will enable the learning of discipline-specific methods of enquiry and knowledge.

Section 5.1 
 Aims
Social Science plays an important role in developing in an individual student a comprehensive 
sense of the human world and its functioning. In an increasingly globalizing and interdependent 
world, this understanding is critical to help students see how things around them are changing, 
what the causes of these changes are, and how the change impacts human societies. It also helps 
them realize the need for interdependence, collaboration, and an appreciation for the diversity 
of human culture and societies. 
The subject also teaches students the method of observing and interpreting the world wearing 
the hat of a social scientist. It does so by building core skills such as observing what is going on 
around them, analysing causes of various phenomena (historical, geographical, socio-political, 
or economic) using evidence, asking questions, making connections, forming viewpoints based 
on conceptual understanding and evidence, recognizing patterns and generalizations, and arriv-
ing at logical conclusions. These skills prepare students in contributing as responsible citizens of 
society. 
Social Science also helps in nurturing the values and dispositions that are essential for sustaining 
cooperative and collaborative communities. It promotes ethical, humane, and Constitutional val-
ues. It encourages them to understand and appreciate the feeling of Indianness ‘Bhartiyata’ by 
valuing the rich cultural heritage and tradition of the country. The subject also helps students 
recognize the importance of sustainable development through the preservation and conserva-
tion of natural resources. It sensitizes them to the impact of human activity on the environment 
and the sustenance of life on earth. In doing so the subject helps students develop a critical un-
derstanding of the environment and the impact of their actions on human and environmental 
well-being. 
The aims of Social Science in school education can be summarised as follows:
a. Develop the disciplinary knowledge and understanding of how society functions 
through an interplay of historical, geographical, social, economic, and political fac-
tors. This can be enabled through:
i. 
an understanding of continuity and change in human civilisation, its causation and 
effect, and its impact on modern life,
ii. an understanding of the interaction between nature and human beings, the spatial 
patterns arising out of this interaction, and its effect on human life,
iii. awareness and understanding of the diversity of people and their practices in different 
societies, regions, and cultures within societies,
iv. an awareness of various social, political, and economic institutions, their origin, 
functioning and transformations over time.
254
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
b. Develop an understanding and appreciation for the methods of enquiry relevant to 
Social Science and deepen students’ skills to engage with the key questions and 
issues confronting society. These could be specifically seen as:
i. 
Skills in sourcing evidence, interpreting them, confirming through multiple sources and 
evidence, and constructing a coherent narrative, 
ii. Skills in recognizing spatial patterns, map-reading, interpretation and analysis of 
various interconnected concepts and processes,
iii. Skills of creative and analytical thinking to form informed opinions, demonstrate logical 
decision-making, and incline towards a problem-solving attitude, 
iv. Skills to collect, organize, analyse, represent, and present data and information on 
various historical, geographical, and socio-political issues, 
v. Skills to question unsubstantiated ideas, biases, stereotypes, and assumptions to foster 
scientific temper and propose meaningful responses to contemporary concerns of 
society.
c. Foster ethical, human, and Constitutional values: As the DNEP 2019 emphasises, to 
foster a “democratic outlook and commitment to liberty and freedom; equality, justice, and 
fairness; embracing diversity, plurality, and inclusion; humaneness and fraternal spirit; 
social responsibility and the spirit of service; ethics of integrity and honesty; scientiﬁc 
temper and commitment to rational and public dialogue; peace; social action through 
Constitutional means; unity and integrity of the nation, and a true rootedness and pride in 
India with a forward-looking spirit to continuously improve as a nation.”[2]
255
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Section 5.2 
 Nature of Knowledge
The nature of knowledge of Social Sciences can be understood as follows: 
a. Evidence-based, empirical, and verifiable: Social Science relies on globally accepted 
norms of enquiry and verifiable evidence, and it cannot be based on the mere speculations 
of an interpreter. It is a subject that is verifiable through observation and experience in 
nature as it is an analysis of what human beings witness in their lives. Its study often leads 
to multiple interpretations of a single event. However, this does not make Social Science 
imaginary or unreliable in its claims. 
b. Social Science is the study of human society: “Social Science is the study of the human 
society which includes people as nearby as family and as far away as those who live in the 
most distant nations. And, the people who are living now, those who lived long ago, and 
those who will live in the future.” [3] It allows students to connect with other people and 
cultural groups and understand their differences and commonalities which creates a shared 
sense of humanity. It is a complex task to understand human society, and this requires a 
multidisciplinary lens consisting of Geography, Political Science, History, Economics, Sociol-
ogy, Public Administration, and Psychology. Geography studies the human relationship 
with the natural environment, History traces the journey of changes and continuity from 
past to present of human life that has undergone major events which impacted society and 
culture, Political Science deals with the socio-political existence of human beings, and 
Economics analyses economic activity and their impact upon social and behavioural 
changes of human beings. 
c. Social Science requires an interdisciplinary approach: As Social Science relies on 
sources, the nature of these sources is always multi-dimensional, found in the form of 
performing and visual arts, literature, artefacts, numerical data, and oral narratives.[4] These 
serve two significant functions. First, they help students to understand people, places, 
ideas, and about the people who created them. Second, such sources enable the students to 
analyse and interpret the beliefs of societies that have expressed themselves through 
various mediums.
d. Values in Social Science vary contextually: Social Science ideas are context dependent. 
The socio-cultural beliefs and values are subject to historical, geographical, and political 
contexts. To understand any society holistically, Social Science evaluates the social and 
political events and issues in keeping with the context of that time and space. 
256
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Section 5.3 
 Current Challenges
Social Science teaching confronts a few challenges in schools. This curriculum attempts to ad-
dress these systematically. The issues are highlighted as follows: 
a. It is well known that Social Science is usually taught as a subject with predominantly rote 
learning of facts like dates in history, names of geographical features across the globe, the 
listing of fundamental rights and duties, and naming of economic institutions. The under-
standing of concepts is often missing in Social Science classrooms. This in turn makes 
students lose interest in the subject as there are too many facts that are expected to be 
learnt without adequately engaging with the reasons behind learning them or the core 
concepts underlying those facts.
b. The other critical issue with Social Science is that the subject is divided into water-tight 
compartments of History, Geography, Political Science, and Economics too early on and too 
strictly. Therefore, the interdisciplinary thinking that students need to acquire to under-
stand society is left unaddressed. Students are not exposed to a comprehensive engagement 
with a particular social phenomenon and might merely look at it from the lens of one of the 
subjects. 
c. Information in the chapters is transacted in the classroom with little or no connection to 
the immediate life of the student. Since the subject is not made relevant to the students, 
it ends up being boring or distant from the students’ lives.
d. Another pressing issue with Social Science is that the content in textbooks is not based 
on facts derived from inquiry and investigation. While there is often multiple contrast-
ing evidence to understand a particular social phenomenon, stressing one piece of evidence 
alone often gives a lopsided/inadequate picture. Within a Social Science class, students 
need to interpret the pieces of evidence and arrive at reasonable and justifiable narratives.

 Learning Standards
Learning Standards provide a comprehensive framework with details of Curricular Goals, Com-
petencies, and Learning Outcomes for teaching any subject. The Curricular Goals explain the 
broader aims and objectives of teaching Social Sciences as a part of the school curriculum con-
veying the knowledge, skills and dispositions needed for developing disciplinary thinking and 
values and capacities to function as responsible and empathetic human beings. The competen-
cies are observable learning behaviours that guide the teacher in assessing the learning of a 
student as they move along a given stage in a subject. The Competency statements are further 
broken down into observable Learning Outcomes. These will serve as guiding posts for teachers 
to plan their lessons, design assessments, modify teaching-learning strategies and track stu-
dents’ progress in a subject.

5.4.2 Design of Content in the Middle and Secondary Stages 
5.4.2.1 
Content for the Middle Stage
a. Content must be taught in an integrated manner.
In the Middle Stage, methods of enquiry used in Social Science would help students under-
stand the nature of History, Geography, Social and Political Life, and Economic life in an 
integrated manner. The choice of content must lend itself to this integrated approach rather 
than requiring strict disciplinary boundaries. 
b. The organisation of content must use a thematic approach (from the local and re-
gional to the national and global).
A thematic approach will guide the curriculum at this Stage. The four themes are to be done 
in progression starting from the local to the regional, then moving on to the country and 
then the world. This approach would ensure that the learning of Social Science is based on 
observable, real-world, relevant, and day-to-day occurrences for Middle Stage students, 
263
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
drawing them into thinking and talking about these. This would also give them a sense of 
their location in the world. Equally importantly, students at this Stage need to learn to see 
real-life Social Science thinking as an interplay of principles drawn from multiple disci-
plines.  
As highlighted in the NEP 2022, “All curriculum and pedagogy, from the foundational stage 
onwards, will be redesigned to be strongly rooted in the Indian and local context and ethos 
in terms of culture, traditions, heritage, customs, language, philosophy, geography, ancient 
and contemporary knowledge, societal and scientific needs, indigenous and traditional 
ways of learning etc. – in order to ensure that education is maximally relatable, relevant, 
interesting, and effective for our students....”[1]. This remains a strong anchor for the content 
in the Middle Stage which would engage students in the understanding of the social reali-
ties of their society. 
i. 
Content about the local context will be 20% of the whole curriculum at this stage. 
Students will explore the various facets of their locality from historical context, 
geographical variations, and its socio-political, and economic life in an integrated 
manner through collecting information/data from multiple sources, comparing data, 
making meaning out of it, doing analysis, and learning how social scientists build 
knowledge about a society based on empirical evidence.
ii. Content about the regional context will be 30% of the whole curriculum at this 
stage. The understanding developed at the local level would be used to deal with 
content at the regional level. In this, a deeper interdisciplinary perspective by 
identifying similarities and differences between their locality and the region would be 
acquired.
iii. Content about the national context will be 30% of the whole curriculum at this 
stage. After the regional, the next theme is India, where students would be expected to 
apply some of the skills learned in the previous themes. Actively engaging with 
secondary sources, the students would make meaning out of them in the context of 
India. This covers the interrelatedness of History, Geography, Economy, and Social and 
Political Life of people. The richness of the multi-ethnic people and their identities and 
the cultural heritage of the country must be introduced here.  
iv. Content about the global context will be 20% of the whole curriculum at this 
stage. Lastly, the world level is intended to prepare students for the 21st century, which 
is an era of globalisation. An understanding of the culture and society of other countries 
would help students to widen their worldview. Students can build a comparative 
understanding of life in other countries in relation to one’s own. This would lead to a 
sense of pluralism and appreciation of various cultures in the world. A comprehensive 
understanding of any three countries that meet the following criteria may be chosen:
1) The three countries must be from different continents with different socio-cultural 
and civilisational histories,
2) One Eastern country that has geographical challenges and has gone through rapid 
growth after struggling through challenging times in its history (E.g., Japan, South 
Korea),
264
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
3) One country that has geographical diversity, has been a colony and has struggled 
through foreign rule and internal difficulties (E.g., South Africa, Nigeria),
4) One country from the West that has grown rapidly, is influential in the global 
economy, with multi-ethnic composition (E.g., the United States of America, 
Germany).
The three countries (Japan, South Africa, and the USA) have been chosen as useable examples 
based on the above criteria and they have been illustrated in the table below. Curriculum/sylla-
bus developers may choose other countries that fulfil the criteria mentioned above, and there 
may be multiple choices for the countries within the same syllabus.
c. All content must be truly and comprehensively representative with verifiable evi-
dence.  
Another important design consideration at this Stage is with regard to the choice of content 
material. Whatever content is chosen, it must be truly and comprehensively representative. 
All Social Science concepts that the students are expected to learn must be backed by 
verifiable evidence. These two criteria mean that the choice of overall content must cover 
the whole sweep and the key issues of the discipline (or the concept at hand) and for these, 
the specific content(s) chosen should be good examples and truly representative of the 
issues/matter. There can be more than one example for given criteria to be incorporated in 
the classroom, and schools can choose based on the judgement that the content is suffi-
ciently representing the key issues or narratives that must be learned in the subject.

Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
5.4.2.2 
Content for the Secondary Stage
a. Content must be organised according to the disciplines of History, Geography, Social 
and Political Life, and Economics. 
In the Secondary Stage, the curricular design need not follow the thematic approach strictly. 
The students are encouraged to develop an interest in academic disciplines and form a 
worldview. The focus of the classes is on enabling the cognitive preparedness of students to 
deal with more complex concepts that require a disciplinary approach.  
The content in History urges the student to understand the evolution of human society. 
Suggested content is aimed at developing a holistic view of the human past by interpreting 
primary and secondary sources. The content must be based on different sources and is 
expected to help students arrive at different narratives about a particular event or period.  
It must cover important phases of the past which shaped the present of human beings. In 
addition, the content explains the concept of ‘many pasts’ and justifies that there cannot be 
a fixed common narrative for everything.  
In Geography, the suggested content focuses on highlighting the interrelation of human 
beings with their geographical environment and other life forms. Concepts highlighting 
interdependence between humans and nature are kept as core areas. The connection 
between various geographical phenomena and the cultural diversity found in the world is 
included.  
In Social and Political Life, understanding democracy and democratic life are the main 
concepts. The content includes an in-depth understanding of the Constitution and the 
working of the Indian Government through a network of social and political institutions. 
Along with this, the prevalence of discrimination in society, its reasons, and ways of safe-
guarding against it are also included. The students are expected to find probable solutions 
to these challenges. With this, the importance of democratic values and voices to ensure a 
dignified life for all in society is highlighted. 
Lastly, in Economics, an introductory understanding of economic activities and the interre-
latedness of these activities with human life, market, and money has been included. The 
content areas encourage the students to understand, observe, and interpret economic life in 
their immediate environment. With this, they would be able to make sense of the economy 
in the emerging global world.
b. All content must be truly and comprehensively representative with verifiable evi-
dence.
Just like the consideration for the choice of content material in the Middle Stage, whatever 
content is chosen for the Secondary Stage too must be truly and comprehensively represen-
tative. All Social Science concepts that the students are expected to learn must be backed by 
verifiable evidence. These two criteria mean that the choice of overall content must cover 
the whole sweep and the key issues of the discipline (or the concept at hand) and for these, 
the specific content(s) chosen should be good examples and truly representative of the 
issues/matter. There can be more than one example for given criteria to be incorporated in 
the classroom, and schools can choose based on the judgement that the content is suffi-
ciently representing the key issues or narratives that must be learned in the subject.

Section 5.5 
 Content
5.5.1 Principles of Content Selection
The driving principle of content selection in Social Science is directed by NEP which emphasises 
“The contents of languages, literature, history, and the Social Sciences will incorporate discus-
sions particularly aimed at addressing ethical and moral principles and values such as patrio-
tism, sacrifice, nonviolence, truth, honesty, peace, righteous conduct, forgiveness, tolerance, 
mercy, sympathy, helpfulness, courtesy, cleanliness, equality, and fraternity.”[2] The following 
principles need to be taken into consideration while selecting the content:
a. Content must be based on multiple pieces of evidence and narratives: As asserted in 
DNEP, “Evidence-based reasoning and the scientiﬁc method will be incorporated through-
out the school curriculum...in order to encourage rational, analytical, logical, and quantita-
tive thinking in all aspects of the curriculum.”[2] A good social scientific engagement with 
any concept or event is only when the person remains open to engaging with adequate 
evidence, sources, references, and narratives. The content should be adequately representa-
tive of multiple pieces of evidence and narratives, of a single event. For example, under-
standing the Gandhian philosophy of non-violence should be done through the readings of 
multiple writers. The content must lend itself to grooming students into confident beings 
who will be able to form and express their opinion after considerable research.
b. Content must be interdisciplinary in approach: Social Science, by its very nature, is an 
interdisciplinary subject. The subject-wise division of history, geography, social and politi-
cal life, and economics cannot be seen as four separate areas in isolation. None of these 
subjects can be taught (or understood) without referring to another. For example, the 
concept of cultural diversity cannot be taught without introducing the student to geograph-
ical diversity. Students learn to investigate a concept from a multi-dimensional view and 
develop an expansive view.
c. Content must enable building core disciplinary skills: Social Science aims at developing 
social decision-making and problem-solving skills which involves the interpretation of facts 
and maps, relying on evidence, and connecting many concepts to form rational opinions. 
The content in Social Science should not only present facts but also encourage analytical 
and inferential capacities through activities in which students consciously engage. 
d. Concepts are built from the simple to the complex: The content in Social Science should 
be organized from simpler to more complex concepts enabling the construction of meaning 
like a building bloc. This is done progressively based on the thinking abilities of students. 
For example, for teaching historical inquiry in the Middle Stage, the content would first 
focus on the identification and differentiation of sources of information. As a second step, 
students must interpret the sources to draw meaning out of them. Third, they collect and 
analyse multiple sources for a single event. And finally, they do a comparative analysis 
between two or more similar events based on findings made through multiple sources.  At 
277
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
the Secondary Stage, when the skills of dealing with content from familiar to unfamiliar 
have been acquired, the content starts dealing with concepts with a more disciplinary 
approach. 
e. Content progresses from local to global: As much as possible, conceptual understanding 
should start from the local context. For example, understanding history by engaging with a 
historical place (Panchayat Ghar, an old school) in the locality, and then moving to the 
regional and national level institutions/sources. 
f.  Content includes real and diverse experiences of people: As Social Science deals with 
society, the study is incomplete with just theories and concepts. Without references to the 
real-world experiences of the people, every concept would be vague and irrelevant. For 
example, the concept of discrimination cannot be taught without introducing the students 
to accounts of people who have faced it personally. This adds relevance to the learning. Real 
experiential accounts would also develop socio-emotional skills of empathy and sensitivity. 
5.5.2 Materials and Resources
A Social Science classroom should include a variety of teaching-learning materials in addition to 
the textbook. Students must be exposed to social and cultural phenomena across time and space 
through sources like local literature, folksongs, stories from one’s region, ancient monuments 
and documents, magazines and newspapers, films and documentaries, autobiographies, biogra-
phies, memoirs and travelogues, audio-visual aids, and maps of all kinds (topographical, politi-
cal, physiographic, demographic, thematic, and GIS maps).  
a. Textbooks:  Social Science textbooks should be made interactive by including reflective 
prompts for the students. These prompts must help with connecting concepts with the 
current lives of the students and suggest activities they can do to explore the ideas with 
their immediate surroundings. Textbooks must have a good number of illustrations and 
thinking activities for students to work on.
b. Digital Material: Social Science teaching become challenging when students are still 
struggling with basic literacy. While literacy needs are fulfilled through reading in Social 
Science, the concepts in the subject cannot be limited by a lack of literacy. If a student can 
engage with a concept through other mediums (songs, movies, and audio clips) they must 
be included as content. Such diversity in content is not only good for students struggling 
with literacy but the whole class as it is enjoyable and an enriched medium of learning. 
Unfamiliar content becomes easier to understand this way. It is also possible to give stu-
dents access to a distant world (in time and space) virtually.
c. Maps and Atlas: A geographical basis for understanding any social event makes the learn-
ing of Social Science rooted in the physical world. A Social Science classroom should always 
have maps and atlases available for students to refer to. The collection of maps should have 
physical geography maps, political boundaries maps, along with thematic maps (population 
density, minerals etc). And these should be of the locality, region, country, and world. 
d. Literature: Works of Literature (fictional and non-fictional) are a very good source for the 
Social Science classroom. Literature that is representative of identities, cultures, phases of 
history, and personalities and forms like historical accounts, diary records, and folktales can 
be used to the advantage of the class.  
278
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
e. Sources from the visual and performing arts: Art forms which depict culture and tradi-
tions are good sources of information and conversation in the Social Sciences. These would 
enrich the class discussions. Also, field visits or digital content can be used to introduce the 
students to the arts related to Social Science ideas.
Teacher’s Voice B-5.5-i (To be edited)
Sources in History 
As a Social Science teacher in middle school, I have been very determined to give my stu-
dents firsthand experience of social science skill as much as possible. In class 6th, I have 36 
students with whom I started the lesson on ‘Sources in History’ and planned to use samples 
of sources, so that my students can do the interpretation themselves.
The objective of the planned activity was to introduce the students with the process of 
source interpretation as the first step to historical investigation. Through this, it was expect-
ed that: 
The students should be able to understand the different type of sources which are used for 
interpreting history
The students should be able to interpret the sources keeping in mind the context of the 
society the source represent
The objectives were aimed at students achieving the following learning outcomes: 
Recognizes multiple sources of information (primary and secondary) to understand the 
historical, geographical, and socio-political aspects of an issue/behavior/practice/belief/
event
Comprehends tables, charts, diagrams, and maps representing social, political, cultural, 
economic, or geographic phenomena
I divided the whole class in six groups and gave these sources to each group with a set of 
questions to discuss amongst themselves. For example, for one of the groups, I gave this 
picture of rock paintings from Bhimbetka Caves, Madhya Pradesh.
279
Part B

The following questions were then discussed:
What can you say about the relationship between animals and people from the picture?
What does the painting scene depict? Discuss amongst yourself if the people are hunting, 
celebrating something, migrating, or doing something else. Build your views with support-
ing arguments.
What are the people holding in their hands? Why are they doing so? Elaborate on your 
views.
Why do you think the paintings were made on the rock walls?  
Where else can you get information about Bhimbetka? What can be the possible methods?
Other groups were given other sources and similar related questions.

Section 5.6 
 Pedagogy
Social Science is often taught as a fixed set of facts without an understanding of how interpreta-
tions play a role in its construction. This has pushed students towards merely memorizing the 
facts from a textbook and this is not an actual learning of Social Science. A Social Science class-
room has to become participative and interactive in nature.[6] Only when students are allowed to 
immerse themselves in the process of Social Science thinking, they will be able to learn the sub-
ject better. Below are some guiding points indicating how children learn Social Science.
Students learn Social Science best when:
a. Content starts with the familiar and the observable to students
b. Newer concepts are learned in connection to existing knowledge: Students learn when 
the knowledge in their long-term memory is used to understand newer concepts [7]. Thus, a 
new concept is taught by making relevant connections to what the students have already 
learnt before.
c. Students are involved as active participants and not passive listeners: Social Science 
has been a textbook-intensive subject for a long time. That makes it a tiring experience 
where students just listen and memorize what is printed as text. For students to become 
active contributors, they must start acquiring this role right from the beginning of learning 
Social Science. For example, a class on governance can begin with the formation of Bal 
Sabha (Children’s Assembly) within the classroom and then be tried at the school level. 
d. Students apply Social Science skills to understand their immediate surroundings: 
When students apply the skills of Social Science like the interpretation of sources, referring 
to multiple pieces of evidence, drawing a cohesive argument from these, and being able to 
discuss an issue with evidence and not speculations, in their day-to-day lives and for 
understanding their surroundings, they learn the subject better. 
e. Students are given diverse learning experiences: Students must get exposure to diverse 
ways of learning Social Science. The students should be taken for field excursions, be given 
project work, and be introduced to digital content. Also, student diversity in the classroom 
can be used as a learning resource, allowing for discussion of diverse viewpoints. This 
would allow for multiple perspectives too.
Pedagogy in a Social Science classroom must consider how students learn the subject better and 
plan accordingly. It must inculcate in students’ conceptual knowledge, fundamental capacities, 
and Constitutional values and dispositions, all of which enable disciplinary thinking among stu-
dents.
281
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
5.6.1 Pedagogical Considerations
The following pedagogical considerations should be kept in mind while planning for Social Sci-
ence classes:
a. Classroom transactions should help students to engage with the method of doing 
Social Science so that learners can appreciate the methods for knowledge creation in 
Social Science. For instance, students may be encouraged to notice patterns in the distribu-
tion of different forms of government like democracies, monarchies, and dictatorships 
across the globe and propose reasons (historical, geographical, socio-political, economic) 
for the existence of those patterns.
b. Classroom teaching should inculcate an awareness and appreciation of normative 
concerns. Students should be given opportunities to reflect on inequities, stereotypes, 
discrimination, and other social and environmental issues in their own environments. This 
should lead to thinking and discussion of meaningful responses to these challenges.   
c. Interdisciplinary thinking should be encouraged and supported to ensure that the 
students develop a holistic and integrated understanding of concepts as they appear in soci-
ety. Any event in history needs to be interpreted in the socio-political context of its origin, 
any geographical phenomena should be evaluated from its impact on space and human 
lives, and its influence on the economy and society. Similarly, any economic concept needs 
to be understood from its historical and socio-political context. 
d. A Social Science classroom should be a place for contesting ideas, debating, and 
arguing with empathy and care. Students must be encouraged to share their diverse 
experiences and reasoning without the fear of being judged or ridiculed. The teacher must 
refrain from imposing their own biases and beliefs upon the children. The entire pedagogy 
in a Social Science classroom should be an attempt to reveal newer dimensions of social 
reality and work towards creating self-awareness and introspection among teachers and 
students. 
e. Facts and concepts in Social Science should be made relevant to the students’ con-
texts and experiences. Such sharing and interactions must be respectful of the cultural 
and socio-economic differences and multiple perspectives among students. 
f. Concepts in Social Science need to be clarified with adequate depth and rigour: In a 
Social Science classroom, adequate time and attention should be given towards concept 
formation and clarity in history, geography, political science, and economics. For example, 
students need to understand the processes of weathering and erosion to see their impact 
on topography and human civilization; engage with the meaning of different types of 
sources of evidence in order to frame meaningful interpretations of historical events; 
develop a comprehensive understanding of concepts of plurality, democracy and diversity 
to appreciate the values enshrined in the Constitution, and those stressed upon in the NEP 
2020. The overall classroom environment should encourage academic rigour in acquiring 
disciplinary thinking.
g. Opportunity to engage with various social-political and environmental challenges 
through investigating and interpreting multiple sources of evidence available such as 
documentaries, literature (books, local stories, travelogues), newspaper reports, relevant 
282
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
films, etc. should be undertaken. Selecting materials that are relatable to students and help 
in developing curiosity about the discipline should be prioritized. At the same time, care 
should be taken to ensure that materials are from reliable sources of information and do 
not depict biases towards/against a particular ideology. 
h. Authentic tasks/performance-based tasks such as project-based learning activities, 
assignments should be incorporated to give learners an opportunity to develop different 
type of capacities like surveying, data analysis, problem solving, and cooperative skills to 
validate and investigate their assumptions and beliefs.
5.6.2 Pedagogical Strategies
To design lessons along these considerations, there are many strategies that teachers can deploy.
These strategies are as follows:
a. Inquiry: Inquiry-based methods help students understand how social scientists generate 
knowledge. For instance, students can make and test hypotheses about factors that influ-
ence migration in their locality or region, the genesis of various settlement patterns in their 
region, why specific types of occupations are more prevalent in specific regions, why people 
along the coastal regions have a specific dietary preference, and so on. 
b. Issues-based learning: Issues-based learning can be a conducive tool for acquainting 
students with various aspects of social realities, integrating perspectives from different 
disciplines in investigating the causes of problems, and in thinking about relevant social 
action. As a subject addressing normative concerns, it is also vital that students learn Social 
Science content by engaging with real issues in their immediate/distant context. For in-
stance, students may consider the problem of drinking water shortage in their area which 
may involve engaging with questions like – what are the available sources of water? How is 
water consumption across different parts of the region/locality? Are there wastages that 
can be avoided? How is water being made accessible to all sections of society? Is there 
unequal distribution? What steps are being taken to purify water- how is it being made 
available to the poorer sections of society? etc.
c. Conversations, discussions, and debates: Conversations are extremely vital in a Social 
Science classroom. These conversations should lead to focused discussions on concepts, 
ideas, belief systems, and value claims. Sometimes these discussions may convert into 
debates in the classroom. It is important to encourage such debates as it provides students 
with the opportunity to put forth their perspectives, resolve conflicts, iron out contradicto-
ry ideas, and learn from each other. However, care must be taken that such discussions and 
debates do not hurt the sentiments of any caste, class, gender or other social groups. Some 
common topics could be - there can be a discussion on climate change, reservation policy, 
diversity in food/clothing as per historical and geographical reasons, practising democratic 
processes in schools, etc.
d. Role plays and simulations: Role play and simulations may help students explore deci-
sion-making processes and finding means of conflict resolution. For instance, role plays of 
the Gram Panchayat/Corporation may be used as a vehicle to explain the functioning of 
democratic institution.
283
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
e. Community service and field excursions: Community service is yet another upcoming 
strategy in a Social Science classroom. It not only involves concrete experiences for learning 
concepts of the curriculum, but also enables students develop the desired values and 
sensitivity towards normative concerns. Students may take up various projects to work 
with local government agencies to acquire first-hand experience of issues and work with 
people in need. Similarly, field excursions are meaningful ways of engaging with the con-
tent- for instance nature walks, heritage walks, food walks, visit to police stations, muse-
ums, post offices, planetariums, visit to government and digital archives, investigation e.g., 
Old family documents, objects, etc.
f. Reflective essays: Students can write reflective essays on various topics related to the 
curriculum. These essays can also be used by teachers to assess the extent to which stu-
dents have learnt the desired concepts and skills. For instance, a reflective essay topic could 
be, “What would be the future of Indian democracy?” “How will dams transform the agricul-
tural productivity in India?” “What are the issues and opportunities of linking rivers?”
g. Project work: Effective Social Science teaching happens when students collaborate around 
a project or a specific task. These could be conducting a survey and interviews (e.g. house-
hold survey, interview of stakeholders of the society such as village sarpanch, etc.), drawing 
a map of their classroom, investigating the historical sources in their region, tabulating the 
types of bazaars/markets, etc. Such projects should be collaboratively designed along with 
students with sufficient time given to collect data, analyze it and present it in the class-
rooms. 
h. Some specific opportunities for projects to create models and artefacts: The students 
should be given opportunities where they can apply their knowledge in creating models 
and artefacts. These could be in the form of poster-making, collection (old coins, newspa-
pers, stamps, types of rocks, leaves, flowers, photographs, pamphlets, etc., models (2-di-
mendional or 3-dimensional. E.g.  monuments, volcano, still scenes, etc.), videos of rally/
haat bazaar/book fair/any social event in their surroundings, etc.

Field excursion
As a Social Science teacher in middle school, I believe that field exposure is a very strong 
part of the pedagogy. It helps teachers in giving a practical usage of Social Science skills, 
and guides students how to observe, investigate, interpret, and come to some conclusion. In 
my class on historical investigation, I planned to take my class 7th of 30 students on a field 
excursion to a local historical site.
The objectives of planning the visit were as follows: 
The students would understand the people, events, problems, and ideas that were significant 
in creating the history of their locality. 
To make the students keen observers towards the place where they live. These skills would 
be used by them to decode about the societies beyond their own locality/ region. This leads 
towards making them holistic thinkers about their own as well other societies.

The students can describe distinctive developments in style and technology used for con-
struction of temples, tombs, and mosques with examples, with help of their local context.
Before the excursion, certain lessons on sources of history and their interpretation were 
done. After 3-4 in-depth classes which involved working with scriptures, paintings, social 
structure, and their own family history, the excursion was planned. I divided the class in five 
groups with each group having a different thing to work upon during and after the field 
visit. This helped giving a clear objective to each student and preparing themselves accord-
ingly before the visit. The division was done as follows: 
This kind of planned excursion will introduce the students to work on interpreting and even 
trying out building history on their own. Involving the students in the process would help 
them relate to historical inquiry more concretely.

5.6.3 Learning Outcome-Pedagogy and Assessment  
  
Interlinkage in the Classroom
The pedagogy in a Social Science classroom must be centered around objectives and achievable 
outcomes and competencies. Assessments should be neatly integrated in the process. All 3 com-
ponents of Learning Outcomes, pedagogical processes and assessments should be carried out as 
an iterative process within a classroom,
Illustratively,
Figure B-5.6-i
In the example given above, the teaching of the concept of democracy should begin with an un-
derstanding of what the expected outcomes are from this topic. These outcomes are a combina-
tion of concepts, skills, and dispositions that students need to acquire. Once the teacher is famil-
iar with the outcomes, they need to systematically use relevant pedagogical approaches to 
initiate and sustain discussions on ideas of democracy in a class moving towards a realization of 
the outcomes expected from them. Well-planned resources, activities, and assignments will help 
in deepening the understanding of this concept. The lesson plan and class process will both de-
termine to what extent the core and essential skills of the subject are to be built. Assessments in 
such a case must be visualized in both formative and summative ways. In this case, a wide variety 
of assessment tasks to check the understanding of the students regarding the concept of democ-
racy would be helpful to modify the teaching-learning processes as the teacher moves along the 
lesson.

Section 5.7 
 Assessment
In education, assessments have usually served a limited purpose of ranking students using paper 
pencil tests and exams. While such assessments have helped in grading students and taking de-
cisions on promotion or detention, their educational value in helping the teacher improve their 
practice or in helping the students learn better has been quite limited. 
Despite several policy level changes in the past few decades in the aims of education and the 
curricular expectation from different school subjects, assessments have unfortunately remained 
unchanged. The narrowness of the assessment has reduced the scope of the subject and the 
teaching to a means of passing the test. Teaching to the test has become detrimental to learning 
a subject well.
5.7.1 Challenges in Assessment and Evaluation 
Designing and implementing quality assessments in Social Sciences has several challenges:
a. Social Science question papers appear to be general knowledge papers where mastery over 
inert facts such as names and dates of events, textbook definitions, names of institutions, 
and key personalities take precedence over the assessment of conceptual clarity, disci-
plinary thinking, and Social Science skills. This has been one of the fundamental problems 
of Social Science assessment that needs immediate attention.
One reason for the above scenario has been a lack of clarity on the curricular goals of 
Social Science and the kind of competencies and learning outcomes that need to be 
achieved through the subject. For example, while learning about a specific period in history 
is it only important to remember the names of the rulers and their key contributions? or is 
it necessary to understand why certain historical events took place during that time? How 
did it influence various aspects of society during that period? What were the implications of 
that period and its events in later times? How were events in one region connected to those 
in another? In the absence of clarity of competencies and outcomes, Social Science assess-
ments suffer from the issue of validity.
a. Another issue in the assessment of Social Science is a lack of common shared under-
standing of what is expected as a response to a particular question. Very often facts 
take precedence over the student’s ability to connect facts, give their opinion on events or 
for that matter suggest a solution to a problem. Even when application-level questions are 
tested in the paper, the expected responses are directly quoted from the textbook. As a 
result, students’ ability is merely judged on the quantity of facts reproduced rather than 
their ability to apply or analyse their thinking. This compromises the reliability of the 
assessment. 
b. The third issue in the assessment of Social Science is little depth and excessive breadth 
of knowledge and understanding. Very often the content in Social Science is so broad that 
teachers end up developing a question paper that tries to cover as much content as possi-
ble. As a result, students get stressed in remembering disproportionately large amount of 
287
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
information. There is also a tendency to mug up few chapters because of which students 
are unable to form a holistic understanding of various interrelated events or phenomena. 
For instance, a student may learn about climate without engaging enough with vegetation 
or soil. As a result of this, their competency to make connections between climate, vegeta-
tion and soil remains under-developed.  
5.7.2 Principles of Assessment 
a. Assessment in Social Science should be ‘understanding what children have learnt and their 
ability to problem-solving and put that knowledge into practice’. It should serve as a tool 
for gathering evidence about students’ learning to make changes in the teacher’s 
pedagogy.
b. Assessments should avoid only assessing inert facts and information. They should measure 
the core concepts, skills, and dispositions that define the curricular goals of Social 
Science. For instance, asking children to trace the history of any monument/temple/ 
mosque/church/monastery in their locality by asking questions to the local people, looking 
at documents of local revenue officer, and other related available records. 
c. Assessment must move beyond paper-pencil tests. It must use authentic assessment 
methods that allow for complex skills and diverse abilities to be tested in more valid 
and reliable ways. Assignments, reflective essays, project works, field surveys, map read-
ing, and interviews must be planned in a manner that the students can be assessed based 
on their understanding of concepts and the processes involved in Social Science. Assess-
ment of collaborative work involving the designing of a poster, developing a movie on a 
historical monument, collecting occupational data of different persons in one’s locality, 
representing poverty or unemployment data in one’s region, interpreting a topographical 
map, etc. should be encouraged. All methods and tools of assessment should trigger stu-
dents to apply and reflect on the concepts of the curriculum. 
d. Assessment items should, as far as possible, address normative concerns such as peace, 
equality, justice, and fraternity amongst students. An important aim of Social Science 
teaching is also to foster values and dispositions. It is necessary for Social Science assess-
ments to help students examine beliefs and biases, do the given task with promptness, do 
the work with efficiency and understanding, argue in favour of and opposition to given 
social reality, participate in group work, consolidate a discussion, be able to find the ele-
ments of equality and diversity in social phenomenon, be able to adjust with diversity and 
change, and have a sensitive relationship with human beings, animals, and the natural 
environment. There is a need to adopt ‘continuous and multi-faceted assessment’ as sug-
gested by the New Education Policy 2020 to highlight the overall capabilities and life-skills 
of the students. 
e. Assessment in Social Science should enable students to form reasonable views and 
arguments that are evidence based and follow an empirical approach. Open ended 
questions that encourage students to evaluate the information, provide arguments and 
support it with valid evidence, must be encouraged. For instance, instead of asking students 
to list the advantages of building dams, students can be asked to evaluate the pros and cons 
of building dams and take a position on whether it is necessary for a country/region’s 
288
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
development? While asking such questions, the answer key/marking scheme should be in 
the form of a rubric where along with facts the quality of the students’ reasoning is as-
sessed.  
f. Assessments should be ongoing and integrated with the teaching-learning process. 
Questioning students, making them do group work, think-pair and share, etc. can be effec-
tive ways to conduct formative assessments in the classroom. While doing such informal 
assessments teacher should be mindful of taking stock of what is the quality of discussion 
in the classroom and accordingly modify her teaching plan. 
g. It is just as important for teachers and assessment administrators to analyse students’ 
responses to develop better quality assessment. Analysing students’ responses will 
inform them about areas of improvement, along with additional support and resources 
required for better attainment of learning objectives.

 Arts Education
The Arts are a vast range of individual and collective human activity that is aimed at creative 
pursuit through innovative and imaginative expression and cultural engagement. They involve a 
wide range of thinking, doing, and responding activities using various materials and media. They 
can very broadly be classified into the visual, literary, and performing arts. 
In the school curriculum, Arts education is about developing the creative capacities, aesthetic 
sensibilities, and cultural literacy achieved through various forms of visual arts, a variety of crafts 
(local living traditions), digital art, as well as the performing arts such as storytelling, puppetry, 
dramatic arts, music, dance, and movement arts. The range of genres could include traditional, 
classical, folk, popular, and contemporary styles of creative expression. 
When students share their ideas and feelings through a variety of art forms like painting, crafts, 
music, dance, and theatre, they recognise one another’s strengths and challenges, which nur-
tures empathy, appreciation, cooperation, and trust. This is fundamental for developing social 
and human values like ahimsa, love, compassion, friendship, and peaceful co-existence.

Section 6.1 
 Aims
For the individual student, arts education in all Stages of school education teaches students ca-
pacities for making, thinking, and appreciating. These three processes are critical for developing 
creative thought and expression in them. The arts are also well known to enable socio-emo-
tional well-being. Research suggests strong links between arts training and overall brain devel-
opment. Exposure to art and the experiences of producing art help with improvement in cogni-
tion and significantly impact individuals in their emotional awareness and regulation.
Since the arts lend themselves to learning experiences that engage many senses at a time, stu-
dents with diverse interests and learning abilities often find their place in the arts. They develop 
skills in crafting and creating artworks, develop aesthetic sensibilities, an appreciation for na-
ture, creativity, innovation, and confidence in their abilities. They learn to find diverse ways of 
persisting and solving various challenges. All these are important for individual growth and 
contribution towards society.
The arts are valuable in celebrating human experiences with collective joy, a means to knowl-
edge, and learning about life. The arts provide enjoyable opportunities for students to connect 
with their own culture and appreciate the diversity of artistic expression in other cultures. As a 
common language, the arts bring people together and lead them to develop tolerance, un-
derstanding, and mutual respect. 
Through a good, effective arts education programme, every student in every school in India must 
be provided equal opportunities to:
a. Enjoy exploring and creating artworks, gain a variety of aesthetic experiences, and derive 
joy from all forms of art
b. Apply one’s imagination and creativity, and learn a variety of artistic capacities through 
experimentation and sustained practice in the arts
c. Express ideas and emotions through the arts, as well as nurture empathy and sensitivity 
towards the expressions of others
d. Appreciate the beauty in nature and discover connections between the arts and other 
disciplines and with everyday life
e. Develop a sense of belonging towards one’s own culture and traditions, as well as an 
appreciation for India’s multicultural diversity and the knowledge of contemporary artists 
and art practices.

Section 6.2   
 Nature of Knowledge in the Arts
The Arts are about human aesthetic sensibility. Aesthetic sensibility refers to our ability to 
perceive beauty, arrive at considered judgements regarding the good and beautiful, and 
strive towards a sense of refinement in the art-making process. Art is a personal form of 
understanding beauty, shape, symmetry, pattern, and movement blended in expression to evoke 
feelings. Artistic work covers both conceptual and procedural knowledge and deals with the 
‘embodied’ sensory and emotional experiences of human beings.
Yatho hasta tatho drishti
Yatho drishti tatho manah
Yatho manah tatho bhaava
Yatho bhaava tatho rasa
- Verse from the Natyashastra
Translation:
Where the hand (action) goes, there follows vision
Where the vision goes, there follows the mind (thought)
Where the mind goes, there follows feeling (emotion)
Where the feeling goes, there follows aesthetic pleasure
‘Making’ is at the centre of artistic work: The above verse in Sanskrit captures the essence of 
making art where the creative process of exploring making first, thinking/reflecting, and appre-
ciating after. The concrete experience of ‘making’ or ‘doing’ is central to the arts, through which 
both artistic processes and concepts are understood. Along with this, ‘how something is done’ 
defines its artistic nature e.g., one can play with utensils to either make disturbing noises or cre-
ate soothing music.
Art sparks attention to new ways of looking: We often are creatures of habit and tend towards 
inattentive repetition. The arts spark attention and a ‘new life’ into our habitual perceptions and 
produce unique and enjoyable experiences. Such experiences contain an ‘activated flavour’ that 
is known as rasa or the aesthetic/artistic experience. 
Artistic exploration occurs within defined rules: Creating art or responding to it requires the 
ability to distinguish aesthetic experiences and make choices based on context, ideas, emotional 
experiences, intentions, and the presence of an audience. Most art forms follow some conven-
tions within which artistic exploration happens. Although these may be read as constraints (e.g., 
295
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
the structure of classical raagas in music), they in fact help in pushing the boundaries of imagi-
nation and creativity since it requires more effort to be creative within defined rules or struc-
tures.
There are differences in the natures of visual and performing arts: There are innumerable 
forms of art broadly categorised into the visual arts and the performing arts (some art forms 
have characteristics of both these). The visual arts offer ‘static’ experiences to viewers e.g., paint-
ings and sculptures that are viewed as complete artworks and do not undergo changes while 
viewing. The performing arts on the other hand offer ‘dynamic’ (time-based) experiences to 
their audience e.g., music, dance, and theatre are dependent on the passage of time for their au-
dience to experience a completed work. A tradition like Patachitra combines aspects of painting 
and performance when the artist sings and narrates the story depicted in the scroll painting. 
Art is a comprehensive engagement: The arts involve complex processes of critical thought, 
expression, and response through a comprehensive engagement of mind, body, and emotion Art, 
like language, permeates all human knowledge in processes of information acquisition, learning, 
and sharing. Playing the flute not only produces an aesthetic experience (rasanubhava) but 
learning to play it develops an understanding of sound and its production, as well as the knowl-
edge of similar materials and acoustics. Theatre and the dramatic arts are by nature holistic 
knowledge systems that combine literature, music, movement, visual arts and crafts.
296

Section 6.3   
 Approach to Arts Education
NEP 2020 mentions that there would be ‘no hard separation among ‘curricular’, ‘extracurricular’, 
or ‘co-curricular’, among ‘arts’, ‘humanities’, and ‘sciences’, or between ‘vocational’ or ‘academic’ 
streams. Subjects such as physical education, arts and crafts, and vocational skills, in addition to 
science, humanities, and mathematics, will be incorporated throughout the school curriculum.’ 
This NCF, therefore, places the arts as one of the main curricular areas. It recognises the vast di-
versity of cultural expressions that exist across the length and breadth of India. Local arts and 
cultures would be the starting point for arts education in all Stages of school education. This 
approach aims to develop an understanding among Teachers and students that the arts are 
around us, and they are an integral part of our life, and therefore an essential subject for students 
of all Stages of education. 
6.3.1 Arts in Stages
At every Stage of Arts Education students learn to express their views on what is ‘aesthetic’ 
which is good and beautiful, and the characteristics that contribute to their ideas of beauty. While 
subjective student views are encouraged, they must also learn about the overarching criteria 
that define the aesthetic qualities of visual artworks, music, theatre, dance and movement. These 
criteria are established through the art form, as well as society and culture. For example, the 
principles of visual design like focus, balance, and proportion would determine the aesthetic 
qualities in various forms of visual arts. However, what is considered a beautiful proportion may 
vary from one culture to another. Students imbibe their aesthetic sensibility from their local cul-
ture. An arts practice helps them examine their aesthetics more closely, and expand their ‘tastes’ 
by participating in art processes.
In the Foundational Stage, children are encouraged to express their views while responding to 
artworks, and they share their personal preferences. By the end of the Preparatory Stage, stu-
dents can be expected to distinguish artworks by quality and level of completion. In the Middle 
and Secondary Stages, students must reflect on their aesthetic choices and not blindly conform 
to trends and cliques because of social acceptance. In these ages, they can learn to push the 
boundaries of aesthetics and culture through gradual steps of inquiry, rigorous exploration, and 
practice, through which they validate their aesthetic choices. As students mature, their observa-
tion and sensitivity to detail develop and this enables them to appreciate well-crafted objects 
and acquire sophistication in their artistic expressions. They develop aesthetic judgement and 
an ability to evaluate artworks based on common criteria.
All creative processes that take place in the art classroom need to involve the pursuit of aesthet-
ic qualities. This in turn reflects in their art-making process by setting higher benchmarks for 
creative refinement in thought, expression, and technical skills.
297
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
6.3.2 Arts Integration
In addition to teaching and learning the arts as a main curricular subject, the arts must also be 
integrated into the classroom practices of all other curricular areas. According to NEP 2020, 
“Art-integration is a cross-curricular pedagogical approach that utilizes various aspects and 
forms of art and culture as the basis for learning concepts across subjects. As a part of the thrust 
on experiential learning, art-integrated education will be embedded in classroom transactions 
not only for creating joyful classrooms but also for imbibing the Indian ethos through the inte-
gration of Indian art and culture in the teaching and learning process at every level”. Schools 
need to ensure that arts-integrated learning is practised in the teaching of all subjects in a man-
ner that gives equal importance to achieving learning in the arts in other disciplines. Arts inte-
gration cannot be a replacement for dedicated art classes in the school curriculum. The arts as a 
body of knowledge have their content, skills, methods, and processes, which require dedicated 
space and time. This document focuses on arts education specific to art knowledge and Learning 
Standards in the visual and performing arts. This would not only guide Teachers in teaching the 
arts as a curricular subject, but also find meaningful connections with other disciplines to inte-
grate concepts, content, pedagogy, and assessment practices.
6.3.3 Emphasis on Process, not Product
Process and not the product is central to learning the arts. Arts curricula across the world have 
recognised the educational value of developing frameworks that are marked by artistic process-
es like ideation, creation, production, performance/presentation, response, review, and making 
connections. This ensures that Teachers and students focus on all aspects of development (cog-
nitive, affective, psychomotor, socio-emotional and language) while learning the arts. According-
ly, the Learning Standards integrate the thinking, making and appreciation processes that are 
fundamental to arts education.
Thinking processes refer to the development of ideas and concepts, creating new meanings and 
connections, understanding art forms and their elements, inquiry and critical reflection on art 
practices and aesthetic experiences, and connecting arts knowledge with the knowledge of other 
disciplines.
Making processes are about the multisensorial engagement in creating artwork, expression of 
thoughts and emotions through different art forms, exploration of materials, tools, and tech-
niques, improvisation, developing and refining craft and skills, and the production of artwork or 
performances.
Appreciation processes refer to gaining exposure to a wide range of art forms and practices 
through both active and passive modes, developing an awareness of sense perception as well as 
physical, emotional, and intellectual states, communicating a variety of responses to art and aes-
thetic experiences, understanding the social, historical, and contextual background of artistic 
practices, assessing artworks, and developing aesthetic judgement.
All these processes are interlinked and cannot be addressed in isolation if a meaningful and com-
plete art learning experience is desired. 
298

Section 6.4 
 Current Challenges
The status of arts education in schools is troubled by several challenges, some of which are as 
follows: 
a. Lack of time, resources, and seriousness given to the arts
Art activities are often limited to fun and entertainment during occasions and cultural 
events at schools. Art Education is either not timetabled at all or they are stopped before 
and during exams. Time allocated for Arts classes is often taken away for exam preparation 
or syllabus completion in other subjects. There is often little/no physical space allocated for 
art activities and little appropriate utilization of art resources in most schools. Added to 
this, there is often very little planning, organizing, assessments, and review in art teaching. 
There are no textbooks/handbooks to guide the art teacher and there is no serious assess-
ment of learning in the arts.
b. Reinforcing stereotypes and meaningless ideas 
In the name of arts, students are made to admire and reproduce stale/unoriginal images, 
e.g., drawings of landscapes with triangular mountains, a semi-circular sun, and a few trees 
regardless of whether the student has witnessed such a landscape. Similarly in Dramatic 
arts, students perform morally heavy plays based on themes with which they have no 
personal connections, or dance to the tunes of popular songs that further reinforce social 
stereotypes. 
c. Acute shortage of well-prepared Arts Teachers 
Schools across the country need many more art Teacher recruitments. Art teaching needs 
preparation. Artists, craftspeople, and performers cannot simply become teachers. Becom-
ing an Arts Teacher requires an understanding of educational perspectives, capacity for 
educational judgement, as well as initial guided practice in art teaching. Teacher Education 
programmes do not have appropriate arts orientation for all Teachers and initial prepara-
tion of specialised arts Teachers.  As a result, Arts Teachers struggle to understand the 
requirements of Arts Education and end up imposing inappropriate expectations on stu-
dents. In cases where Teachers of other subjects show an interest in the arts and their 
teaching, it is neither appreciated nor supported. 
d. Social aspirations
There is a general lack of interest towards arts education in society since people lack aware-
ness about its educational value in developing aesthetic, creative, and cultural capacities in 
students. The wide scope for pursuing arts as a career also remains unknown to many.
299
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Box B-6.4-i 
Addressing the Constraint of Teacher Availability
Many schools do not have dedicated art teachers or adequate space and materials for the 
arts. In such cases, schools could choose from various forms of visual and performing arts 
that are already practised in the region, identify local artists who could be resource 
persons and use natural materials and local resources for arts facilitation. Local 
potters, toy-makers, basket weavers (E.g., Gond, Warli, Madhubani, Maandana), and practis-
ing artists (E.g., sculptors, photographers, book illustrators, muralists) in the locality could 
be invited to the school to lecture-demonstrate. With some education and initial support in 
learning pedagogical practices, these artists may even be employed part-time or full-time by 
schools. However, until such an arrangement happens, Teachers need to ensure that arts 
education aligns with the core principles mentioned in this document by assisting resource 
persons when they visit to teach the arts. 
In the Foundational and Preparatory Stages, art classes may be facilitated by any Teach-
er in the school who has a basic orientation on arts education for the respective Stages, 
or with the assistance of local resource persons. They must encourage students to openly 
express their ideas and emotions and playfully experiment with a range of materials in 
forms of visual arts (rangoli, drawing, painting, textile arts, puppetry, sculpture, pottery 
etc). 
By the Middle Stage, schools must prioritise recruiting at least one exclusively as-
signed art teacher who can teach either the visual arts or performing arts or both. A 
Teacher for the Middle Stage should have the capacity to provide appropriate encourage-
ment and inputs to nurture the individual creativity of all students and expand their range 
of artistic expression.
In the Secondary Stage, schools need to ideally recruit one Teacher for the visual arts 
and one Teacher for the performing arts who have adequate knowledge of the arts, as 
well as education perspectives that are required for teaching the arts at the Secondary 
Stage. Until these ideal scenarios become achievable, schools could collaborate with arts 
organisations and the local art communities to fulfil the arts education needs of the curricu-
lum. 
School libraries often have very little material on the Arts. They should include a wide 
range of books and audio-visual resources. These could be museum/exhibition cata-
logues with images of artworks, books on artists, art magazines/periodicals related to the 
visual and performing arts, children’s literature with artistic illustrations and so on. Song-
books with musical notations or literature for drama could also become important refer-

Section 6.5 
 Learning Standards
The Learning Standards in this section are for the visual arts, theatre, music, and dance and 
movement. All schools must aim to provide maximum opportunities for students to explore any 
form of visual arts AND any form of performing arts (music, theatre, dance, and movement) 
across all the Stages. The art forms that are chosen by the school should be appropriate and ac-
cessible to all students and have relevance in their contexts. Based on the art forms that a school 
chooses, the relevant Learning Standards specific to the visual art form or performing art form 
can be applied. Teachers need to understand the importance of process in all art forms and en-
sure that students develop the necessary Competencies by the end of every Stage.
A ‘Nested’ Design of Learning Standards: Giving due consideration to the time schools might 
require in the implementation of Arts Education as a full-fledged subject across the Stages (for 
example appointment of teachers, acquisition of resources), this document contains  ‘Nested 
Learning Standards’ for Arts Education, wherein Learning Standards have two subsets which 
have been detailed. The first subset called Learning Standards 1 is nested within Learning Stan-
dards 2. Thus, ‘Learning Standards 1’ should be accomplished by all schools from the very 
initiation of the implementation of this NCF, and Learning Standards 2 should be accom-
plished as soon as schools add the required resources for Arts Education.
The table below illustrates how can implement this.

based on discussion with 
peers before presenting 
completed artworks e.g., 
makes edits based on 
discussion with peers 
regarding colours,  decora-
tive elements (creating 
patterns, textures),  adding 
or changing text (what they 
would write), and other such 
aspects before completion
Considers different contexts for 
presenting visual artworks and plans 
work accordingly
e.g. Discusses sizes of the poster based 
on where it will be displayed and 
identifies appropriate places  for 
displaying the poster; considers text 
content, size of text, type of images, 
background colours, spatial divisions, 
margins, etc.;

National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Section 6.6    
 Content 
6.6.1 Principles for Content Selection
Students are exposed to a variety of art forms through their local culture and traditions, as well 
as entertainment channels in the media and the internet. Therefore, Arts Education must consid-
er what students already know and are exposed to and provide opportunities to discuss and re-
flect on emerging trends and practices in the cultural space. The selection of content for arts 
education would take into consideration the following principles:
a. Consider age-appropriate themes: The themes and topics that are chosen, as well as 
physical capacities/technical skills that are required for the chosen arts activities, should 
consider students’ age group, developmental stage, and diverse learning abilities.
b. Include a diversity of context, resources, and artistic genres: Starting with the familiar 
and local in the younger age groups, content could gradually expand to examine the diversi-
ty in regional, linguistic, national and international contexts. As the content progresses in 
the different Stages, it must cover a breadth of genres which include classical, folk, tribal, 
popular, and contemporary forms of art. Materials and resources that are locally or natural-
ly available must be prioritised. 
c. Uphold the dignity of all types of work: Content should not reflect any hierarchies among 
arts processes. It must give equal importance and value to all kinds of physical, intellectual, 
and emotional work. Similarly, the content should present a wide scope of skills ranging 
from simple to complex, and in roles ranging from minor to major.
d. Encourage questioning and critical reflection: Although the arts are subjective in nature, 
artistic expression and discussion should encourage students to reason their choices, 
compare and analyse the processes, and connect them with their aesthetic preferences. 
Dialogues around art and aesthetics must aim to develop multiple perspectives and respect 
diverse viewpoints.
e. Uphold values: The chosen content must teach students an appreciation for multicultural 
diversity and inclusion, concern for democratic values, respect and compassion for a variety 
of artistic expressions, and an interest in working towards justice through creative modes, 
peaceful dialogue, and cooperation.

Ancient Indian texts like the Natyashastra, Abhinaya Darpanam, Shilpashastra, Vaastushastra, 
and Chitrasutra have codified and structured the elements, methods, and aesthetic principles of 
the arts. The arts of India are one of the most diverse, rich, and expansive in the world, and con-
temporary art practices combine the knowledge of Indian arts and traditions with knowledge of 
arts from different parts of the world. All the arts have certain elements and principles that pro-
vide a framework to create and evaluate artworks. While some of these (e.g., bhaava or emotion) 
316
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
may be common across different art forms, some elements are specific to the visual arts and 
others to the performing arts. Students need to develop knowledge of these elements and prin-
ciples and a vocabulary of the arts used to describe and discuss artworks and their processes.
The following table is a suggested illustration of the elements and principles of the visual and 
performing arts, which could be introduced at every Stage. This is informed by the developmen-
tal stages that occur in students. Elements introduced in the early years will continue to be ap-
plicable in the later years, with a gradually increasing level of complexity.

6.6.2.2 
Materials, Tools, and Techniques
Materials, tools, and techniques play a critical role in every art form and even shape traditions, 
styles and genres. An age-appropriate introduction to materials, tools, and techniques must be 
followed across all Stages. A premature introduction to advanced tools or an overemphasis on 
technique alone can result in blocking exploration and innovation or might prevent a student 
from enjoying the process of creating artwork. It must be remembered that the focus of arts ed-
ucation is to provide wide exposure to a range of materials, techniques, and tools before devel-
oping excellence in any one art form or process. 
a. Materials 
Materials could be chosen based on the school’s geographical location (weather conditions, 
native flora/fauna), local culture, and locally available resources. Schools can, like many tradi-
tional art practices, conscientiously source materials and tools from nature. It is recommend-
ed that all schools minimise the purchase of paper, plastic, styrofoam and thermocol as mate-
rials and instead recycle the same from other sources like packaging materials. Processes like 
paper mache can be introduced as sustainable alternatives to recycling paper for creative use 
in the arts. 
Examples of materials that are sourced from nature
Natural elements like water, air, and light play an important role in many material transforma-
tions and processes. Other natural materials could be soil, sand, mud, clay, pebbles, rocks, 
stone, minerals and metals, sticks, dried logs, wood, brick, charcoal, seeds, seed pods, leaves, 
stems, flowers, fruits, vegetables, natural rubber, natural gum, grains and their powder, shells, 
feathers, and natural fibres (cotton, jute, palm, wool).
Teacher’s Voice B-6.6-i(To be edited) 
Art from natural materials
The students in Grade 5 know and tell many stories, 
and they have even written and created their own 
illustrated stories. This time, I decided to assign a 
task that is related to story illustrations but would 
not be on paper or in the form of a book. In fact, it 
would be impermanent. They had to work in groups 
and create outdoor artworks in which they used only 
natural materials or found objects sourced from the 
school campus. Of course, they were also given the 
condition that they could not harm plants by pluck-
ing flowers and had to source from what had fallen 
on the ground. 
During the activity, each group selected a story and 
decided on a scene that they would depict in their artwork. Once outdoors, they quickly got 
to work as they picked stones, pebbles, twigs, leaves, flower petals, and so on. They busily 
318
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
discussed their ideas as every material triggered their imagination to improvise on the spot, 
make changes in their visual, and even come up with their own stories. The students had to 
think differently and be creative to find the objects to convey the shapes, forms, colours, and 
ideas they had in mind. One group decided to use a drinking-water tumbler with a little 
water to become a well in their artwork. The time-limit to complete their work in one period 
also made them be mindful of their plan, and they worked energetically and efficiently. 
Some groups borrowed ideas from 
others as they saw them using 
different materials. When all groups 
completed their artwork, each group 
presented their story along with the 
artwork and the others responded to 
their artworks by telling them what 
they found interesting in their use of 
materials, how their compositions 
conveyed different ideas and stories 
and what they each learnt from the 
process. The groups also reflected on 
the collaborative experiences within 
their groups. 
Examples of materials that are available in stores
Chalk, crayons, pastels, paints (watercolour, poster colour, tempera, acrylics), inks, rangoli 
powder, a variety of fibres and threads for textile arts (cotton, nylon, wool, silk, etc.), gums and 
adhesives, paper and cardboard in various sizes and thickness, fabric in a variety of textures, 
prints, and patterns; rubber, wooden boards and blocks in smooth, textured and carved vari-
ants, plates and sheets of different metals varying in lustre and thickness, beads, wires, straws, 
and rods made of different materials.
b. Tools
While selecting tools and instruments across the arts, the student age group, their prior 
knowledge, and exposure to various tools and instruments need to be considered. Students 
learn the knowledge of:
i. 
Appropriate selection of tools and instruments
ii. Grasping, holding, and operating tools and instruments
iii. Safety precautions in using the tools and instruments
iv. Care for the tools and instruments.
Examples of tools and instruments used in the Visual Arts
Pencils, pens, markers, brushes, rollers; erasers, sponges, palettes, sharpeners, scissors, cut-
ters, scrapers knives, needles, pliers, punch, potter’s wheel, wooden modelling tools, spoons, 
spatula, palette knives, carving tools, hammer/mallet, chisels, files, saw, hand drill, measuring 
instruments like measuring tape, scales, compass, protractors, weighing scales, recording 
equipment like cameras, digital software and applications, sewing machines can be intro-
duced at the Secondary Stage.
319
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Examples of tools and instruments used in the Performing Arts
Natural materials, pitch pipes, tuners, traditional, electronic or digital forms of surpeti/shru-
ti-box, tanpura/tambura, metronome, tabla and other taala aids, ektara, a variety of percus-
sion instruments, selected string instruments, wind instruments, string instruments, harmo-
nium, keyboards, bells, ghungroos, lighting equipment for stage, sound equipment like 
microphones, amplifiers, mixers, speakers, recording equipment for video and audio, cos-
tumes, jewellery, make-up, stage props, and sets.
c. Techniques
All art forms can be introduced to children across the stages with age-appropriate techniques 
and relevant adaptations in materials and tools. Teachers must choose techniques and pro-
cesses that are suitable for students based on their age, attention span, interest, prior knowl-
edge and experience, and also consider knowledge, skills, and dispositions that are desirable 
at every Stage. For example, the technique of working on a potter’s wheel requires a variety of 
motor skills and strength, which may be more appropriate for students in the Middle or Sec-
ondary Stages. At the Preparatory Stage, students can be introduced to pottery techniques 
that don’t require a wheel like pinch-pottery or coil-pottery techniques. As a precursor to the 
technique of weaving, students in the Preparatory Stage can be introduced to the techniques 
of braiding, using palm fronds or thick jute ropes. In the Middle and Secondary Stages, stu-
dents can learn to make simple hand-held looms and weave with wool, and jute, and try bas-
ket weaving too.
Examples of techniques  and Processes used in the Visual Arts
Drawing, sketching, journaling, painting, dyeing, printing, pottery and ceramics, photography, 
film and video, animation, collage, assemblage, construction, building, modelling, carving, en-
graving, etching, embossing, digital fabrication, braiding, weaving and knitting, cutting, sew-
ing and embroidery.
Examples of techniques and Processes used in the Performing Arts
Warm-up games, exercises and activities for voice, instruments and body movement, brain-
storming, mind mapping, noting and visualising ideas on the board, drama games, image 
making or tableaux (motionless individuals making a still scene), improvisations and their 
different variations, scene work, stagecraft, rehearsal techniques, run-throughs, techniques 
for ensemble/group performance, solo performance, movement choreography, composing 
music, reading and writing poems, stories, scripts, and musical notation.
6.6.2.3 
Artists and their Practice
An insight into the lives of artists, their practices, and the environment that supports their prac-
tice helps students develop an appreciation for the arts and enhances their cultural sensibilities. 
Exposure to lecture demonstrations by various artists (men, women, and transgender) who are 
known locally, regionally, nationally and internationally across different periods would inspire 
students to engage with art forms. 
320
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
6.6.2.4 
Arts Etiquette and Ethics
Students of all stages must be introduced to arts etiquette and ethics, e.g., conventions of saluta-
tion, bowing to the audience, acknowledging all the people involved in the production, including 
credits of sources and resources that were used during production, habits of cleaning and caring 
for tools and instruments. In the Secondary Stage, students could also be introduced to intellec-
tual property rights, fair use, and the laws that relate to creative ideation, production, and dis-
semination.
6.6.2.5 
Familiar Themes
Familiar themes make the thinking, making, and appreciation of art more accessible to students. 
Themes like life and work of people, traditions and cultures, characteristics and arrangements of 
objects, living beings in the natural environment, stories, folk tales, myths, legends, poetry and 
other forms of literature, values like love, friendship, equality, justice, and concepts like war, 
peace, education, and health give some direction to creative thinking and expression.
6.6.2.6 
Interdisciplinary Practice
The social sciences and the arts are closely interlinked. History, arts, archaeology, architecture, 
conservation, contemporary crafts traditions and contemporary arts practices can all be ex-
plored through the lens of examining the social, economic and cultural lives of people. Similarly, 
language, literature and arts are to be viewed as different forms of cultural expression and hu-
man communication. Concepts like symmetry can be explored through the language of visual 
arts, crafts, dance, movement, and mathematics. Sound and its properties can be studied through 
music, drama, physics, biology, and language. Colour can be explored through visual arts and 
craft practices such as natural dyeing, geography, chemistry, physics, biology, and political sci-
ence (issues of race and colour). More such content can be chosen for arts integration practices.
6.6.2.7 
Content Packages for Students and Handbooks for Teachers
Arts Education will require thoughtful designing of content that encourages multisensorial ex-
ploration and learning. A conventional form of a textbook may not be suitable or adequate for 
effective arts learning and it will need workbooks and instructional manuals. All of the arts would 
require a well-organised archive of resources (online and offline versions) that contain good 
quality images, audio, videos, and multimedia resources adequately supported by text/audio 
information to describe the artworks in the archives. Content in the archives must represent the 
artistic and cultural richness of every region in the country from past to contemporary. Such ar-
chives could be used in designing modules for each art form while allowing room for the local 
arts too. 
Content packages for students must include exploratory activities that encourage them to in-
terpret artworks, experiment with materials and tools, exercise their imagination, and express 
their ideas and feelings openly. All content should be inclusive and made accessible to students 
321
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
with disabilities. Active student exploration, engagement, guided and independent practice, re-
flection, reattempting expression, and building aesthetic capacities across age groups are the 
spirit and vision of arts education. Content packages must reflect these demands.
A well-designed handbook for Teachers of every Stage would help the Teachers understand the 
Aims, Learning Standards, and appropriate Content and Pedagogy for arts education through il-
lustrative classroom examples. These handbooks must have suggested lesson plans and assess-
ment frameworks for hands-on activities with the time required for these. Pre-service training 
and in-service training can teach Teachers to meaningfully use the content and methods suggest-
ed in the handbooks.
322

Section 6.7    
 Pedagogy
Knowing how students learn the arts is important to plan for effective pedagogical strategies in 
Arts Education. The following are some things to keep in mind in this regard. 
Developmental stages in children also directly correlate to their aesthetic development. 
Recent research has found that very young children make free associations with art based on 
their own experiences without much external influence. As they grow, they develop a preference 
towards realism, they appreciate the artists’ technique, skill, patience, and hard work. In their 
adolescent years, they begin to value originality, emotional expression, and creativity. These 
phases of artistic development can be observed across the visual and performing arts too. The 
ages are not absolute and valid for each student, as some may skip individual phases in the de-
velopment of their artistic expressions, or at times fall back on an earlier one. A balance of guid-
ed exploration and free play is necessary for students to appreciate art. They should learn to 
think reflectively about the arts, practice making artwork, and incorporate ideas and methods 
into the personal art-making process progressively.
All students regardless of their differing abilities can engage in arts activities. They must 
be encouraged to openly exchange ideas and express themselves. Art classes must foster peer 
learning and an appreciation of diversity. Exploring and building on capacities must be the es-
sence of art classes. 
Arts Education not only develops skills/craft of making/performance but also parallelly 
develops creative thinking capacities, expression of emotions and aesthetic sensibilities. 
An arts Teacher needs to have a deep knowledge of the arts and an approach to teaching the arts 
that is not necessarily driving students to become artists themselves. 
Content and processes can be effective when they are Stage-specific. For example, in the 
Preparatory Stage, the emphasis would be on expression and communication, whereas by the 
time they reach the Middle and Secondary Stages, they would be introduced to more specific 
frameworks in the thinking, making and responding processes. Given below are some common 
underlying pedagogic principles that will be applicable across all Stages of school education
Box B-6.7-i
.
Skills Required for Arts Teaching
An Arts Teacher in the Preparatory stage must have a clear understanding of the aims of 
education and arts education, a familiarity with the stage-wise curricular goals, grade-wise 
competencies, and related learning outcomes described in NCF for arts education, a basic 
understanding of the nature of art forms as areas of knowledge, and a high inclination 
towards continuous self-study in arts.
Added to the expectations mentioned for teaching in the Preparatory Stage, an Arts Teach-
er for the Middle stage must have an awareness of local art and cultural practices, the 
ability to make connections between local art and cultural practices with the Stage-wise 
competencies of arts education, and help children in developing respect towards multiple 
arts and cultural practices from their region/state.  
 
323
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
A Secondary Stage Arts Teacher must have disciplinary specialisation and a rigorous 
understanding of the arts. They must be able to develop an interest amongst students in any 
one form of visual or performing arts and develop an appreciation for diverse art practices 
and traditions in India. They must demonstrate rigour and regularity in art-teaching 
processes (rehearsals, performances, making/displays at the school level and inter-school 
events), be able to motivate students to imaginatively apply learned artistic methods, create 
an environment of respect for multiple viewpoints and a variety of arts and cultural practic-
es from different parts of India, and spend their time with students looking at and engaging 
with many forms of artworks from across the country and the world.
Based on the above features of how students learn the arts the following are some principles of 
Arts Education pedagogy.
a. Arts Education must be process focussed: The products of art and performances are 
organic consequences of the various artistic processes that are in themselves enjoyable and 
instances of learning achievement. A Teacher would therefore need to closely observe every 
student’s involvement in the processes of thinking, making, responding and appreciating 
the artwork. 
b. Pedagogy must be driven by students’ experience and collaboration: When students’ 
expressions become the starting point in art classes, they would be able to connect arts 
concepts more meaningfully, and this provokes them to discover new ways of understand-
ing their own experiences. All arts activities need to encourage dialogue, and collaborative 
work, where the sharing of ideas nurtures care and concern for multiple viewpoints and 
expressions. For example, when a teacher discusses the variety of organic and geometric 
shapes that can be observed in various examples of local forms of visual arts, the chances of 
discovering and identifying different types of triangles, circles, and amoeboid shapes would 
be much greater, than if the Teacher were to begin by drawing a triangle on the board and 
telling students to use it in their artworks. 
c. Variety, variations, and interdisciplinary practice must be encouraged: The arts are all 
about variety, perceiving and creating variations even while repeating or reproducing tasks.  
The focus of the arts is to discover newness even in the most familiar experiences. Arts 
pedagogy should therefore encourage students to stretch their imagination to find multiple 
ways of expressing their ideas and emotions in arts and other subjects. Drama and theatre 
by nature are composite art forms that include knowledge and processes of visual arts, 
crafts, design, literature, music, dance and movement. It is important for students to not 
only gain embodied experiences through the arts, but also discover and articulate the 
connections across disciplines, and how they are experienced through different art forms. 
Teachers need to identify concepts and themes that interlink the knowledge of different 
disciplines and explore interdisciplinary pedagogies through projects, Teacher collabora-
tions, and by inviting artists and experts from other fields.

Music and Movement
Rhythm is an important element in music, dance, and 
movement. All students instinctively respond to 
rhythms. In the music classroom, we often begin with 
warm-up activities that are guided by rhythm. 
I either play the dholak or play one of the pre-set 
rhythms on the keyboard we have in school. I give the 
students names of animals or vehicles or objects as 
prompts, which they interpret on their own through 
rhythm and movement. There are two objectives of 
this activity. The first is that they listen to the rhythm 
and move their body according to its tempo. The 
second is that they get comfortable with moving 
their bodies freely and gradually overcome any 
self-consciousness. We first ensure that there is 
enough space for free movement, and no one gets 
hurt. When I say ‘Jalebi- slow’, they start moving 
different parts of their body to mimic the squiggly 
shape of a Jalebi. Each child moves differently ac-
cording to their own imagination and their comfort with their own body. They observe and 
mimic one another too. When I say ‘Jalebi-medium’, they continue their on-the-spot-improvi-
sations and increase the tempo. When I say ‘Jalebi-fast’, they really speed up the movement 
with great energy and excitement. 
This helps students imagine and move freely and develop a sense of rhythm.
d. Local resources, arts, and culture must be emphasised: The appreciation of local culture 
in arts pedagogy could provide the needed variation in perspective to popular culture when 
it also makes room for questioning, analysis, and critical appreciation. As students progress 
through higher Grades, critical examination and appreciation of the arts need to be encour-
aged. NEP 2020 suggests “the hiring of outstanding local artists, writers, crafts persons, and 
other experts as master instructors in various subjects of local expertise; accurate inclusion 
of traditional Indian knowledge including tribal and other local knowledge throughout the 
curriculum, across humanities, sciences, arts, crafts, and sports, whenever relevant”. 
325
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Schools could invite local artists, crafts persons, and performers as well as archaeologists, 
museum employees and other relevant arts administrators to share their work through 
lecture-demonstration workshops, and art melas in schools supported and mediated by the 
Arts Teacher.
Teacher’s Voice B-6.7-ii (To be edited) 
Folk art
Maandana is the folk art of Rajasthan, Malwa and Nimar. This art form is primarily prac-
ticed by women, where they paint patterns on the floor and walls of their homes. They first 
prepare a base on the ground or wall using cow dung and clay/brick, after that painting is 
done on it with the help of chalk. Cotton or a clump of hair is affixed to the end of date twigs 
to serve as a brush with which they draw and fill colour. 
This year in school, we decided to introduce 
students to Maandana since it is the local art 
form of this region. We invited a few local 
artists for a workshop with our students in 
Grade 6 to familiarize them with the processes 
involved in this art form. Before doing this 
activity, we also showed some videos to the 
students which featured well-known national 
award-winning artists who have specialised in 
Maandana over many decades. This helped 
students understand how the knowledge and 
techniques of this art form is passed on through 
the generations, and how a simple art form like this enhances the beauty of all homes in this 
region. Through this workshop, students were able to experiment with the materials and 
processes used in this art form. It also gave them an opportunity to work collaboratively in 
groups. 
An interesting incident that occurred on that day was that when parents of other children 
came to pick them up from school found that a Maandana workshop was being conducted, 
they too got interested and joined in to create their own Maandanas. Many of our 
non-teaching staff also created Maandanas that helped students observe and learn from 
multiple people. The event organically brought people together and students enjoyed 
learning from their local community.
e. Many opportunities for arts exposure and aesthetic appreciation must be made: The larger 
aim of developing aesthetic sensibilities and cultural literacy can only be achieved when 
students are given sufficient exposure to good examples of visual and performing arts from 
different parts of India and the world across genres, and adequate focus on contemporary 
art practices. Within the school, students could be shown appropriate examples of film, 
video, animation, photography and images of original works of visual arts and the perform-
ing arts, and these could be discussed after viewing. In higher Grades, students can be 
326
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
encouraged to write art reviews and include them in the Deewar Patrika (Wall Newspaper) 
or a monthly school magazine. Assemblies and cultural events must also be seen as oppor-
tunities for constructively reviewing performances and the aesthetic arrangements and 
experiences through the events. Whenever possible, besides classroom teaching, other 
modes for exposing students to the arts are workshops, projects, exhibitions, visits to 
museums, and local arts centres would be very valuable learning modes for students. Visits 
to archaeological sites, monuments, performances of music, food festivals, local folk dances, 
theatre performances, exhibitions, museums, and art galleries could include specifically 
planned activities and learning projects both on-site and after returning.  
f. Students with Disabilities must be included: Students with disabilities must be given 
equal opportunities and access to participate in all art activities. Their participation and 
engagement will depend on the level and severity of the disability. Their independent 
working with a focus on what they “can do” rather than what they “cannot do” would 
empower them as learners. They should be given the choice of mediums and levels at which 
they can engage with the activity with adequate encouragement and support from the 
Teacher. For example, some suitable visual arts activities for them might include clay work 
to build dexterity, dabbling with paints, blending to create new colours, cutting shapes and 
pieces out of different materials to glue and form abstract patterns, stencils used to trace 
outside as tracing inside within the confined space might be difficult for them, they can be 
made to paint with fingers if holding the brush is a problem. Some suitable performing arts 
activities could include listening to different kinds of music that they are interested in, 
playing musical instruments like any kind of drums, or encouraging them to create free-
form dance and movement to music. Students with disabilities must be included in all art 
processes including discussions. Their responses could be verbal or non-verbal, and these 
must be acknowledged,  appreciated, and included in the pool of responses and opinions in 
the classroom.
g. The physical space, materials, and resources must be prepared before class: Teachers 
need to ensure that the materials and the space where arts activities are conducted are 
prepared and safe for all students. For example, in the visual arts, clay may need to be 
prepared in advance so that it can be shaped or modelled into different forms. The Teacher 
can either choose to prepare this themselves or in the case of Middle and Secondary Stages, 
teach the students to prepare. In schools where there may be limited space for performing 
arts, the Teacher could think of moving furniture around to make space for movement 
activities. Time must also be allocated for students to clear the space, clean the used tools, 
and put away their materials after work. 
h. Teachers must prepare with the knowledge of effective pedagogic processes and 
strategies: Being a good artist cannot automatically imply being good at teaching art and it 
is very essential to be an effective arts facilitator for teaching arts. A Teacher who may not 
have specific art skills can facilitate interesting and effective art sessions for students if they 
have the required knowledge of art pedagogy and the relevant pedagogic skills. Arts peda-
gogy must include teaching processes like making lesson plans keeping in mind learning 
goals, choosing appropriate content and instructional design, and relevant assessment 
strategies. In the class, strategies such as warm-up activities, exploratory games/exercises, 
brainstorming, mind mapping, discussing, individually conversing, assigning projects and 
homework, going on exposure visits, field trips, planning for a question and answer session, 
and using the board to jot down and consolidate ideas, reflections, and responses would all 
be useful.

Improvisation is a method used in the dramatic arts that involve spontaneous unscripted action 
or role play based on any given location or situation during practice. This illustration shows how 
this method can be introduced and practised with students at different Stages. The correspond-

– their improved capacity to retrieve 
previous experiences, sustain the 
role and position of the characters/ 
situations; and represent their ideas

Activity Process followed at the Preparatory Stage
Step one (Stage consideration- Group size)
The Teacher divides the whole class into 6 sub-groups of 5 students each 
Step two (Stage consideration- Time)
One by one, each group comes to the area marked as the performing space in the classroom.
Step three (Stage consideration- elements of drama being explored)
The teacher assigns three locations to each group for them to imagine and develop a situation/
scene involving different characters and actions through role play. Locations could be home, rail-
way station, sabzi mandi (vegetable market), Principal’s room, hospital, Panchayat Bhawan, play-
ground and so on.

Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Step four (Stage consideration- orientation of exploration)
In 10 counts given by the teacher, the students discuss the characters, fix their roles and start 
playing the situation immediately, spontaneously. The students have to go on playing until the 
Teacher says “freeze” to stop the role play.
Step five (Stage consideration- developmental stage of students)
After the presentation of each group, the Teacher can lead the session for reviewing the  exercise 
with the following suggested questions:
• What did you do in this exercise?
• What did you like in this exercise?
• What did you achieve through the exercise, as a team and as an individual?
• How did you decide about the characters and situation?
• What were the challenges you faced while discussing and playing the situation?
The review can be done by the teacher from two points of view i.e., own review of the performing 
groups and other groups as an audience.
Step six 
The Teacher writes the reflection of the students on the board while also introducing details of 
the technique of role play and situation building.

 Assessment
Assessment in the arts would help Teachers, students, and families of the students understand 
the learning achievements of students, giving a clear description of the strengths, challenges, and 
interests of every student, and where support can be offered or taken for growth. In the arts, care 
must be taken to see that assessment does not place too much focus on a singular judgement, 
rather it should be a collaborative process of feedback between Teachers and students over mul-
tiple instances. Given that the arts celebrate individual expression and creativity, as well as the 
fact that the arts rely on individual subjectivity, assessment in the arts must distribute its focus 
across the students’ thinking, making, and appreciating capacities.
6.8.1 Principles of Assessment in the Arts
a. Assessment requires both Teachers and students to be aware of the Learning Standards that 
need to be achieved.  This also implies that students can clarify what they are expected to 
do and openly share their difficulties in meeting those expectations.
b. Assessment must be approached with the fundamental belief that all students can be 
creative.
c. Assessment of learning in the arts needs to be based on evidence that includes their 
engagement and participation beyond that which is observed in the art classroom and 
school premises. 
a. Assessment in the arts is most effective when it includes processes of self-assessment, peer 
assessment, and assessment by the Teacher, as these correlate with the responding and ap-
preciating processes carried out in arts activities.
6.8.2 Guidelines for Assessment in the Arts
a. Criteria for assessment in the arts need to be framed around the art processes of Making, 
Thinking, and Appreciating. The criteria must be communicated and discussed with 
students so that they are aware of the learning expectations.
i. 
Making capacities can be assessed by observing the students’ physical and 
psychomotor skills while using a variety of materials, tools, instruments, and 
techniques (steady and firm grip while holding tools, clarity in visual elements); their 
ability to generate a variety in expressions (e.g., variety of visual effects, variety of 
musical sounds, variety of body movements, variety of speech intonations); their ability 
to present their works (e.g., communication of ideas and visual presentation in front of 
an audience); and their ability to work individually and collaboratively (e.g., 
cooperation with peers, seeking and offering help).   
ii. Thinking capacities can be assessed by observing the students’ cognitive skills like 
ideation, creativity, imagination, organisation, comparing, analysing, reflection, 
exploration, experimentation, persistence, criticality, and communication. For example, 
if a student in Middle Stage chooses to copy imagery from a photograph, their creativity 
can be assessed by the tools they use to replicate it. Using the technique of using a grid 
331
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
may be more creative than directly tracing from a photograph. If a student chooses to 
use a grid despite knowing that tracing may be easier, it reflects their persistence to 
challenge themselves. Adding one’s own elements, or modifying the images copied from 
another source would reflect a student’s imaginative capacities. 
i. 
Appreciating capacities can be assessed by observing students’ ability to observe and 
respond to works of art with sensitivity and attention to detail; their use of art vocabu-
lary, their ability to express aesthetic preferences, empathy, and respect for diverse and 
multiple viewpoints (e.g., a student may respond to the texture of an artwork by saying 
‘its texture is prickly and makes me feel a little uncomfortable’. Another student may 
respond differently to the same work and express that the prickly sensation conveys a 
sense of danger)
b. Consider the students’ learning and performance across a longer period, taking into account 
the various artistic processes, and not limit the assessment to  only a few examples of 
artworks or performance  
c. Consider the inputs gathered from peer assessment and self-assessment processes, as well 
as informal conversations with students and their family members.
d. Include observations of student participation in community arts practices in their homes or 
larger cultural events
e. Encourage students to develop and maintain a personal art portfolio in both visual and 
performing arts
Teacher’s Voice B-6.8-i (To be edited)
Art portfolio
All students in our school have an individual folder in which they store their artworks that 
are in the form of drawings, collages, paintings, and fabric artworks. I also take photos of 
their three-dimensional artworks in clay and paper and have a digital folder on the school 
computer. At the end of every term, I devote one or two classes for students to manage and 
consolidate their folder of drawings. They check that the artworks are properly dated and 
have their name. In case they have forgotten to write the date, they check with their peers 
and write it down. While they do this, I have individual conversations with some of the 
students to review their works and reflect on the changes that they observe over time. I have 
found that most students are able to self-assess and express what they have learnt and what 
they can do better. I take notes during this process. In the higher Grades, students are asked 
to select artworks from their folder to present in an informal classroom exhibition. They 
also include any artworks of pottery, sculpture, textile arts, story illustrations, posters, and 
so on that they have created during the term. Some students also write about their art and 
art processes. If possible, we invite students and Teachers from other Grades to view the 
exhibition and provide their feedback. The students enjoy the process since they don’t see it 
as an ‘exam’ and are enthusiastic to exhibit their artworks and share it with a larger audi-
ence.
332
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
6.8.2.1 
Formative Assessment
Formative assessment should be continuous and comprehensive, where multiple contexts are 
considered as sources and sites for art assessment. Within the art classroom, assessment could 
be carried out through class discussions, class presentations and reviews, individual conversa-
tions with students about their artistic processes, and by the Teacher’s systematic note-taking 
practice that records students’ participation in the arts and their progress in the development of 
skills and capacities.
6.8.2.2 
Summative Assessment
Summative Assessment in the arts could be conducted twice a year across all Stages. These 
should not be events conducted over a couple of hours on just one day.  Instead, these could be in 
the format of projects or week-long events. Some ways of achieving this format could be as fol-
lows:
a. Project work that is based on the different exercises and activities that students are 
introduced to during regular art classes.
b. Presentation of artworks in the mode of an informal display/exhibition/performance, 
followed by a peer review process. At the Preparatory Stage, this could be done at the class 
level, in the Middle Stage this could be done during school assemblies over a week or in the 
form of a Mela at the Stage level, and at the Secondary Stage, this could be imagined in the 
form of larger events that involve the entire school and an external audience.
c. Portfolio of artworks in the visual and performing arts
Summative assessment can have the option of using multimedia resources in both the visual and 
performing arts to view artworks and respond through written or spoken modes.  Care must be 
taken to retain the artistic and aesthetic nature of the subject, leading to enjoyable experiences 
in the assessment processes as well.

Indicators for Assessment:
1. The following can be observed during discussions in the classroom, during individ-
ual conversations with students, and informal interactions outside the classroom:
a. Talks about the feelings they experience in everyday situations at home and in school
b. Discusses their challenges (issues they have with friends and family, issues related to their 
own appearance or abilities) with peers and Teachers 
2. The following can be observed during the process of creating artworks, and after 
the completion of several artworks:
a. Depicts their emotional experiences and personal challenges in their visual artworks 
through recognisable images e.g., creates the figure of a person in a hunched posture to 
express despair or disappointment
b. Depicts their emotional experiences and personal challenges in visual artworks through 
symbols and abstraction e.g., Expresses their emotions through sizes of forms, textures, and 
colours 
Summative Assessment:
After completion of 8 or 10 pieces made by every student, including studies, sketches, 
and a few finalised completed iterations. The learning indicators need to be assessed 
across these artworks and consolidate the self-assessment, peer assessment, and Teach-
er’s assessment. The consolidation can be reflected as given in the table below.

Interdisciplinary Areas
[To be edited]
NEP commits to: 
a. Education about the environment and related urgent issues such as climate change; and the 
development of moral and ethical capacities 
b. Multidisciplinary education that fosters interdisciplinary learning. Interdisciplinary 
approach uses knowledge and process capacities from more than one discipline to examine 
a central theme, situation, event, issue, or concept. 
The NCF leverages the inherent synergy of these two commitments – good education about the 
environment, and development of moral and ethical capacities requires an interdisciplinary ap-
proach.  
Accurate, valid, nuanced, and comprehensive understanding of the world is by nature interdisci-
plinary. Thus, interdisciplinary learning is invaluable to understanding the world, to grapple 
with its issues, to act, and to develop further knowledge.  
The NCF approaches these two NEP commitments in the following manner:
a. In all curricular areas and subjects within them, opportunities exist and have been 
developed for interdisciplinary learning by appropriately integrating concepts, content, and 
methods from other subjects (disciplines), 
b. Subjects at appropriate school stages have been designed for Environmental Education, and 
the development of moral and ethical capacities in an interdisciplinary manner. In addition, 
other relevant interdisciplinary subjects will be offered to students  
At each of the school stages, the two approaches lead to:
a. At the Foundational Stage, Curricular Goals are organised around the domains of 
development, and not specific curricular areas/subjects. Therefore, interdisciplinarity is 
inherent at this stage; in-fact at this stage, the notion of disciplinary methods and content is 
not even introduced, and so even the interdisciplinarity is implicit. 
b. At the Preparatory Stage, Curricular Goals are organised into five curricular areas/subjects 
– Language, Mathematics, Arts Education, Physical Education, and World Around Us. 
i. 
World Around Us, in particular, is designed as an interdisciplinary area, specifically 
meant to help students observe and understand their immediate social and natural 
environment. 
ii. At this stage, all subjects will methodically bring in methods and concepts from other 
subjects, for example, Mathematics in Language, and vice versa.
336
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
c. At the Middle Stage, Science and Social Science are introduced. These curricular areas 
introduce disciplinary methods and understanding. Interdisciplinary learning, including 
about the environment, is developed through interdisciplinary goals and competencies in 
the learning standards, and all related curricular actions to achieving those – from content, 
and pedagogy, to assessment. 
a. In the Secondary Stage there are eight curricular areas - Mathematics & Computing, Sci-
ence, Social Science, Humanities, Vocational Education, Physical Education, Arts Education, 
and specifically designed Interdisciplinary subjects, some of which directly address Envi-
ronmental Education, and ethical and moral capacities. The seven discipline/field based 
subject areas will adopt the same approach as in the Middle Stage for interdisciplinary 
learning. In the Interdisciplinary Areas:
i. 
In Grades 9 and 10, the following subjects will be learnt: 
1) Individuals in Society in Grade 9.
2) Environmental Education in Grade 10.
ii. In Grades 11 and 12, Interdisciplinary Areas, can include a range of subjects, 
illustratively, Sustainability and Climate Change, Public and Community Health, Media 
and Journalism, Legal Studies, Commerce, Family and Community Sciences, Legal 
Studies, Knowledge of India/Indian Knowledge, Traditions and Practices/Indian 
Knowledge Systems. The list and offering of subjects would depend on other practical 
considerations such as availability of teachers. 
The specific aims of each Interdisciplinary Area Subject would be to develop an integrated un-
derstanding of the chosen subject matter, while developing interdisciplinary capacities. 
Box B-7-i 
This document is divided into three sections which do not follow the progression of the 
school stages. These sections detail, first, the approach to Environmental Education 
throughout the school curriculum (Section 11.1), second, the subject Individuals in Society 
in Grade 9 to develop specific capacities related to ethical and moral reasoning and engage-
ment with current affairs (Section 11.2), and finally, the choice-based courses offered in 
Grades 11 and 12 (Section 11.3).

Section 7.1 
Environmental Education
Nature has been an integral part of Indian life and traditions - the lives of communities and the 
environment around them are unconditionally interconnected. The environment includes both 
– Prakriti or nature and Samaj or socio-cultural life of individuals and the community. As humans 
are a part of this environment, the society we live in also becomes an integral part of the environ-
ment. 
Box B-7.1-i 
Indian tradition looks upon man and nature as ‘waves of the same river.’ Life, at its core, is a 
process of interchange between the environment and human existence. This process is 
explained by a term Yantraruda, which means a wheel fitted with buckets for the irrigation 
of fields. The constant efforts of humans to preserve the environment, and in turn be pre-
served by it, is in the form of a cyclical process, with balance and harmony between the 
environment and humans.
A balance and harmony between human societies and nature has been maintained over the cen-
turies. The Constitution of India emphasizes this connect – among the fundamental duties in the 
Constitution of India, citizens must ‘protect and improve the natural environment, including for-
ests, lakes, rivers and wildlife and to have compassion for living creatures.’
However, as human society changed over the centuries, the dependence of humans on nature for 
individual sustenance has decreased. Additionally, the growing need for roads, and polluting 
transport and industries has degraded the environment in various ways. This has led to an im-
balance that has impacted not only the environment but also the well-being of human societies 
at various levels. Concern for this situation has been expressed by several sections of society, 
including by the Supreme Court. Recently, Mission Lifestyle for Environment (LiFE) was launched 
to enable individual action.
Box B-7.1-ii 
At the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference (UNFCCC COP26), the Prime Minister of India 
announced Mission LiFE – Lifestyle for Environment. 
LiFE is meant to support replacement of the current ‘use-and-dispose’ economy with mind-
ful and deliberate utilization. Individuals will be encouraged to take up simple activities 
that can contribute significantly to climate change when taken up worldwide. 
LiFE plans to create and nurture a global network of individuals, namely ‘Pro-Planet People’ 
(P3) who will have a shared commitment to adopt and promote environmentally friendly 
lifestyles. Through the P3 community, the Mission seeks to create an ecosystem that will 
reinforce and enable sustainable environmentally friendly behaviours.
338
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
7.1.1 Preparatory Stage: World Around Us
Students are naturally inclined to observe their natural and social (which includes physical as-
pects that are connected with humans1) environments. They participate in several interactions 
– social, with nature, living and non-living things, and relationships within families and commu-
nities. They experience emotions related to these experiences. Further, personal and cultural 
identities are often tied to the local environment. Thus, there is an essential need, especially for 
young students, to understand their environment.
World Around Us uses the natural curiosity and creativity of students to move towards develop-
ing an understanding of their environment. It helps students move from concrete understanding 
to conceptual understanding. This lays the basis for movement towards more abstract concepts 
at the end of the Middle Stage, and in later stages, while preparing them to engage with the larg-
er world.
At this Stage, students learn best by doing. One way of helping them engage with their environ-
ment is to give them materials to work with, and to help them create simple artefacts. Therefore, 
prevocational capacities are integrated naturally into this subject.
As children engage with their environment, they represent and express their understanding in 
different ways. This enables the use of Competencies related to other curricular areas as well. 
World Around Us thus enables the development of Competencies related not only to the environ-
ment, but also arts, language, and mathematics.
7.1.1.1 
Aims of World Around Us
World Around Us lays the basis for environmental literacy through helping students formalise 
their informal understanding of the environment. They develop an appreciation of their imme-
diate environment and sensitivity towards their own needs as well as the needs of others. Stu-
dents also develop process capacities and learn about tools to make sense of their environment.  
The aims of World Around Us in the school curriculum are to enable students to do the following:
a. Engage with social and natural environments: Students become aware of different 
components of their natural and social environments, as well as their interdependence. 
They develop capacities to explore their immediate environment.
b. Sensitivity and taking action: Students develop sensitivity towards the components of the 
environment, and develop values and dispositions mentioned in the NEP 2020. They 
understand the role they can play in improving their immediate environment. They develop 
a basic understanding of actions they can take to help themselves and others.
c. Love and appreciation for natural and social environment: Students see the beauty in 
form, colour, shape, structure in the natural environment, and in social processes that 
strengthen values and dispositions, and nurture individuals and society.

7.1.1.2 
Approach
The approach will be to focus on the immediate environment of students, with gradual progres-
sion of some aspects beyond the city/town/village at the end of the Preparatory Stage. The inter-
disciplinary approach taken will reflect the lives of children. This will also ensure that students 
develop a holistic view of the world, with an understanding of relationships and interdependen-
cies.
Knowledge, values, and dispositions will be developed through various sources from the locality, 
region, and country. Focus will be on stories, poems, narratives, folklore, histories, and games 
from diverse sources. 
Vocational Education will be integrated in World Around Us through the development of prevo-
cational capacities. Capacities related to understanding the occupations around them, observing, 
and engaging with animals and plants, and creating simple objects lay the foundation for devel-
opment of vocational capacities in the Middle Stage. The pedagogy at this stage will lend itself to 
the development of prevocational capacities, for example, maintaining flowerpots/kitchen gar-
dens, clay modelling, and dialogue with shopkeepers during visits to the local markets. 
7.1.1.3 
Nature of Knowledge
Knowledge in World Around Us is concrete, not abstract, and related to the real world. It is devel-
oped through exploration, discovery, dialogue with peers and adults, visits and excursions, ob-
servations, and creating artefacts. It is also developed through stories, poems, folklore, and other 
forms of arts and literature. 
a. World Around Us brings together the understanding of different aspects to derive 
generalised concepts related to students’ immediate environment. These concepts are 
largely around patterns, processes (social and natural), and interconnections between the 
environment and human society.
b. World Around Us provides process capacities and provide tools to make sense of and to 
interact with their immediate environment.
c. World Around Us develops environmental values and dispositions – aesthetic values, 
appreciation of diversity, love and respect for all beings, acceptance of multiple points of 
view, sensitivity towards the use of resources, concern for dignity, justice, and rights of all 
beings.
7.1.1.4 
Subject-Specific Challenges
At present, Teachers do not have specific expertise to teach World Around Us. Generally, Teach-
ers who take up Environmental Science (EVS) in Grades 3-5 have a degree in Science or Social 
Science. Generally, Social Science Teachers teach EVS, since there are multiple vacancies for Sci-
ence Teachers. As there is no formal structure to prepare Teachers for EVS, often the focus tends 
to be of the subject they are comfortable with.
Activities indicated in the current syllabus of EVS are generally done in isolation. Their continu-
ity with learning is missing. For example, if students go on a visit, there is no discussion related 
to concepts once they return.
340
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Content related to the natural environment is managed easily by Teachers but where the social 
environment is concerned, Teachers are unable to drive discussions, despite the content provid-
ing sufficient opportunities. So, activities are once again done in isolation. 
A major issue is that societal practices and observations are often the opposite of what is taught 
and discussed in schools – this defeats the basic purpose of this subject. If Teachers are not re-
flective, these practices appear in their practice, and may contradict what is in the textbook.
7.1.1.5 
Learning Standards
The Curricular Goals and Competencies for World Around Us indicate the expectations from stu-
dents related to understanding of the environment at this Stage. A structured exploration of the 
environment develops understanding, as well as the capacities to deepen and extend this under-
standing.

Content
7.1.1.6.1 
Principles of Content Selection 
The following principles will inform the selection of content for World Around Us.
a. Content selected should help sharpen competencies through enabling task-oriented 
activities that are thoughtfully planned and connected to concepts. It must enable essential 
process capacities (observation, data collection and analysis, discussion, etc). For example, 
i. 
Assign tasks based on the natural curiosity of specific questions/ assumptions of 
students – they could be asked to observe and record the growth of plants from seeds 
under different conditions (in different kinds of soil, under different amount of 
sunlight). 
ii. Extend this experience to students’ own lives and ask them to describe their 
observations on how crops grow/ plants grow in pots. They can discuss the various 
uses of plants.
343
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
iii. Organise visits to local markets, fairs, museum, local mandi, monuments, etc, and share 
observations and experiences throughout the processes using different modes.
b. Content selected should enable maximum possible social interaction, and interaction with 
the natural environment. For example,
i. 
Identity and relationships within family and community; Plants and animals; Own 
body; Geographical features; Transportation and communication; Institutions; 
Migration of families; Different habits in different communities (food, practices, 
traditions); Food habits and shelter of animals; Various local traditional art forms; 
Festivals and celebrations; Community eating and marriage celebration; Day and night 
- patterns; Sun, moon, and stars; etc. 
c.  Content selected should reflect diversity, and must be inclusive while developing sensitivity. 
For example,
i. 
Geographical, flora, fauna diversity around them
ii. Impact of hot weather or excessive rain on plants and animals
iii. Practices related to work especially with reference to gender - division of labour at 
home, food distribution in families, understanding context of migrant labourers.
d. Content must cater to different communities, languages, and different kinds of people.
e. Content of Environmental Education should be contextual and related to the immediate 
environment. At the same time, exposure to different contexts is also important – multiple 
geographies, genders, communities, etc. For example, 
i. 
If the concept of ‘Transport’ has to be discussed, content can include the pictures in the 
textbook, discussion of modes of transport in the community, sharing of narratives of 
travel by students, local news reports related to transportation, instances of use of 
these roads by the local community, videos of modes of transport that are not available 
in the locality (e.g., train in remote school in the upper   Himalayas).
ii. Communication is seen primarily through the mobile phone (occasionally landline) and 
electronic mail. In rural areas, the predominant form is mobile phones. However, it is 
useful to give all students an idea of snail mail.  This will help students experience the 
excitement of the movement of a physical artefact across space. It will also help them 
understand the concept of communication through a concrete process, while 
appreciating the diversity of communication that still exists in our communities. 
iii. In an urban context, bullock cart is an unfamiliar sight while in a rural context, metro 
railway is unfamiliar. Therefore, both can be included in the content.
f. Content selected should be such that it can be presented in multiple ways, which go beyond 
the textbook. For example, students should have the opportunity to explore the same 
content in various modes as indicated below - 
i. 
Case studies
ii. Visual representation through pictures, simple maps, etc
iii. Using ICT based resources – video to give evidence for discussions and/or support 
discussion on specific issues 
iv. Poems, stories, plays, games, news stories
v. Folklore, folk songs, oral histories, and oral narratives
344

g. Environmental values and dispositions must be integrated in the content, and should enable 
pedagogy that is not didactic/prescriptive but provide a rationale. For example,
i. 
Judicious use of water  
ii. Dignity of all living beings
iii. Impact of humans on the environment
iv. Needs of plants and animals 
h. Content must incorporate Indian knowledge and local culture. For example,
i. 
Food preservation 
ii. Processes to conserve resources, including local wells, stepwells, bawdis 
iii. Local literature – alignment with contemporary knowledge, natural disasters, and 
human-nature conflicts

7.1.1.7 
Pedagogy
Environment, for students at the Preparatory Stage, is what is immediately around them and 
affects their life. Students learn about the environment through structured interaction with their 
natural and social environment, exploration, discussion of experiences and observations, inter-
action with adults and peers, exemplars, task-oriented activities, structured observations, and 
visits. 
This engagement with the immediate environment provides a base for moving into exploring 
larger systems (from locality to district to region to state to nation to world), broader issues 
(from home to community to larger society), and an expanding understanding of concerns, con-
nections, and consequences. Thus, students’ engagement with their immediate environment 
leads them to an understanding of distant environments – they are able to apply their under-
standing from ‘near’ to ‘far’ and vice versa. 
Values and dispositions related to the environment are best developed if they are demonstrated 
– e.g., collaboration, respect for diversity, inclusion, sensitivity towards the environment – by 
adults in the school. Students must also get the opportunity to practise them in their interac-
tions. 
7.1.1.7.1 
Pedagogical Approaches
Students’ questions and experiences – related to the social and physical environment, and of 
social processes around them (including schools and family) – must be given space. This estab-
lishes a level of trust and empathy between the Teacher and students. 
Instead of facts, Teachers need to help students develop a deep understanding. This implies that 
sufficient time for exploration and discussion must be provided. Time will also enable develop-
ment of the ability for critical thinking through the use of different modes and methods, that are 
interactive, and through observation and dialogues, and the communication of ideas. Visits to 
institutions, excursions (including within the school campus) also play an important role in 
learning
349
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Task-oriented work, wherein they take up some small tasks, helps students connect learning to 
doing. Through the creation of simple models, toys, etc, they can communicate their understand-
ing and make learning concrete in the process. Allowing students to take the lead in material 
development, through a variety of modes like art and craft, story, drama, etc., provides space for 
them to be involved in several small and large-scale assignments and projects.
Teachers must also be aware of values and dispositions that can be developed through activities, 
and plan deliberately to offer students experiences to engage with and develop values and dispo-
sitions. They should also make them explicit for students by drawing attention to specific values 
and dispositions (e.g., collaborative learning, working in diverse groups, analysis of work distri-
bution at home, food habits).
The table below details how specific pedagogical aspects can be implemented.
Table B-7.1-v
Aspect
Pedagogical Suggestion
1
Exploring 
the world 
around us 
through 
observation
Observation as a pedagogical approach starts with the immediate environment (home and 
school). Students observe things around them, their processes, characteristics, utilization, and 
patterns. To observe is to provide an opportunity for students to engage all their senses and 
have students base their understanding of the environment on these sensations. The process 
of observation needs to happen in a frequent, continuous, and consistent manner as the skill 
of observation develops over time and the area of observation expands. For example, initially, 
students process all sensations as one, and recognise some details (colours, sounds, and 
patterns). Consistent and planned observation of one’s surroundings develops familiarity, and 
adds depth to their knowledge, like becoming capable of identifying and expressing  minor 
details, e.g. the texture of leaves and insects, a leaf providing shelter to a caterpillar during 
rain.
Exploration is a more detailed process of observation, with comparison, differentiation, 
classification, data collection, and analysis. Students can explore the immediate surroundings, 
i.e., home, school, and neighbourhood for different objects/flowers/plants/animals/birds for 
their simple observable physical features (diversity, appearance, movement, places of living, 
food habits, needs, nesting, group behaviour, etc.). 
Exploration leads to curiosity, developing simple questions about the immediate environ-
ment. Responses to these questions should come from various sources – from within the 
environment, discussions on books, stories, games, etc.  
An important part of exploration are visits. Physical visits in the field are essential for explora-
tion and must be planned accordingly. However, certain visits that cannot be done in physical 
mode can be done through alternate modes like videos, images, stories, etc. For example, in a 
remote mountain village, there are no trains, but these can be understood through videos or 
stories. Whatever the mode of visits, Teachers must discuss the purpose of the visit, a simple 
framework for observation, etc. Teachers must also allow space for students’ narratives about 
their visits during holidays.
350
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
2
Discussion
All processes need to be followed by or rooted in discussion. Discussions should happen 
among students, students and Teachers, a student and her family members, students, and 
members of the community, and also include conversations a student might have with oneself. 
Discussions should become a process where observation-based ideas are shared. There 
should be a gradual development in articulation by beginning with simple descriptions and to 
sharing reflections. Discussions can be around a single theme, which involves thinking, 
analysis, reflection and integrating multiple points of view. 
While observing one’s locality, and expanding the scope of exploration towards the region, 
State, or nation, students can have various thoughts and opinions. Discussions can explore 
various lines of thought such as analysing scenarios to decide what is acceptable or should be 
avoided. For example, students have found that garbage water runs across streets in the 
village used by everyone. The discussion should not be about resolving what is right or wrong 
– it should be about assessing the cause, its impact on everyone in the village, and what could 
be the action. An open space for discussion to express all opinions should be created so that 
students go through the process of thinking, analysing, reflecting, and integrating multiple 
points of view.
3
Expression
Students can express themselves through various modes as: oral, written, drawings, craft such 
as models, simple case studies, maps, roleplays, etc. 
Visual representations also help students develop their understanding of various things 
around them, e.g., graphs, diagrams, sketch, and simple maps. 
Narration is also a unique form of expression as the focus is not on the details, but covers the 
context, analysis, and concluding aspects that the student has landed on. For example, a 
student can share the event of a minor bike accident in their village by including their rela-
tionship with the injured person, a previous incident, next steps, and so on. This narration 
does not necessarily focus on the accident but captures the child’s relationship with the 
injured and opinion about a particular mode of transportation.
Students can also ‘create’ to express their thoughts in visual form. For example, they can 
express their understanding that bus is a means of transportation by creating a simple model 
of a bus with its route. 
Students can also get objects and describe them as part of ‘show and tell’.
The focus must be to streamline the expression so that students portray their own experienc-
es and understanding. This practice should be evolved by setting a context through sharing 
small anecdotes related to the surroundings, and encouraging them to share their under-
standing and similar experiences. For example, Teachers might mention what they saw on 
their way to schools to create curiosity and set the context for students to share their own 
thoughts. This will set the context for further discussion of concepts. 
Illustration of roleplay based on discussion:
Roleplay can be used so that students can play, explore, and comprehend experiences from 
their lives. The theme/topic for the roleplay can be derived from the content being covered. 
For example, if shelter is the content area, a discussion can be initiated around the kind of 
houses in the neighbourhood. Students will share what kind of houses they live in, their 
experience during particular seasons, or even during a natural disaster. The group can arrive 
at a consensus on which story or incident will be used. Students can create their own dia-
logues, including deciding what expressions should be played to represent the emotion in the 
scene. Discussion is what ties in the blend of doing and thinking. In the process of the roleplay 
or afterwards, there can be a discussion on certain issues (e.g., challenges among people in 
marginalised communities, etc.) 
351
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
4
Questioning
Asking questions to students at various intervals supports them to express what they have 
observed, and also focus on particular details. For example, a Teacher can support students to 
express what they have observed by asking questions like, do all leaves on a tree have the 
same colour? Is the pattern of all the leaves the same? Do the trees around have the same 
leaves? Students can be encouraged to add more to these questions.
Students will ask questions by imitating the kind of questions Teachers usually ask them. 
Thus, exposing students to a wide variety of questions in a core strategy to enrich students’ 
expression, and develop the skill of questioning among students. The process of formulating 
questions itself is an important part of pedagogy. Questioning involves sharp observation and 
a basic understanding of concepts. Making questions involves thinking in multiple directions. 
For example, does the tree have flowers or fruits, how does it make food? Is it used in our 
daily life? 
The process of creating questions also involves identification of sources that can answer these 
questions - can elders provide the answer? Can observation over a period answer these 
questions? This process also leads to increased curiosity, and develops prediction, estimation, 
analysis. The process of seeking answers also leads to the ability of refining questions and 
which questions can be asked from other persons (e.g., which are personal, which may hurt 
the other person). Care should be taken to ensure all students ask questions and each one 
gets a response.
5
Using 
various 
modes
Modes such as field visits, exposure visits, roleplays, projects, data collection, melas, art and 
crafting, gardening, film screenings, story narration, games, poems and songs, map making, 
and interactions with locals and artisans will be planned and initiated. A variety of modes are 
essential as students cannot develop their understanding only through books and readings. It 
needs to be balanced with opportunities to have direct interactions with the environmental 
issues and aspects so that they can think, explore, start questioning, analyse and reflect their 
understanding in a constructive manner. 
Pedagogy must be such that it results in curiosity about natural and social phenomenon. This 
can be done through direct interaction, and experiences should be facilitated with the natural 
and human environment. In this process, both Teacher and students can identify questions to 
be explored. 
Group at this stage stimulates students to realise the importance of and processes for working 
in groups. They must appreciate the exchange of ideas, support for each other, providing 
space for others, not isolating oneself or others. This lays the foundation for collaborative 
work in later stages.
352
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education

Preparation 
by the 
Teacher
It is essential for Teachers to maintain clarity while responding to students’ questions. Their 
responses should be grounded in facts, and presented in a way that students can comprehend 
it. 
As most of students’ learning is expected to occur in an activity-based mode, the process and 
parts of the learning experience must be clear to the Teacher. For example,
Instead of going in an ‘event’ mode, the Teacher should align with the  Curricular Goal/
Learning Outcome, processes. For example, making a collage is a simple activity, but it can be 
made meaningful through identification of specific themes, categorization of pictures, place-
ment in a meaningful manner, etc followed by a discussion of what the collage depicts.
Every student should get the space to participate actively in all the learning processes. While 
the challenge of managing these processes for all children is a reality, certain deliberate 
strategies need to be in place. For example, the Teacher will be responsible for the overall 
process, but students will be divided into smaller, manageable groups. The Teacher may not 
be able to reach every group within the duration of one Grade but will ensure that her 
interaction is balanced among children in all groups over a fixed period.
Grouping of students for different activities should address most, if not all the diversity that 
exists in the classroom. For example, one activity cannot provide the space for all students to 
work with one another. However, a series of activities should be planned so that students’ 
grouping changes and students get a chance to work with each other in 1-2 of a set of 6 
selected activities in a month.  
Safety and security of students should also be planned ahead in time by the Teacher, especial-
ly for processes outside the classroom. 
Materials used and developed by the Teacher and students must be organised in a classroom 
(e.g., as part of the learning corner). This display should be dynamic, relevant to the ongoing 
classroom process, and organised in a manner that students understand and integrate the 
setup into their learning process.
Documenting students’ work for fixed periods of time integrates the learning expectations, 
classroom process, and assessment process. The onus of this documentation need not fall on 
the Teacher alone – the setup can be initiated by the Teacher, while the responsibility of 
maintaining it can lie with the students. For example, the Teacher can create a file for a 
students’ portfolio, while the responsibility of attaching the work attested by the Teacher lies 
with the student.

Field Visits
I organised a visit to different shopping regions for my Grade 4 children in three groups to a 
grocery shop, a local shop, and the weekly market. Although we were visiting different 
places, they each had to collect the same data by talking to the shopkeepers: items available, 
daily income, and how they attract customers. They also had to make a list of at least 20 
items that are sold at the shop and write the quantity and price. As each group visited a 
different kind of shop/market, the process of analysing and sharing the data they had 
collected was very interesting. First, a child from each group read the list of items they had 
noted down. Then, we wrote the daily income of each of these shops on the blackboard. 
Underneath this, we began to add the points they had collected on what strategies the shops 
use to attract customers. We noticed that the local grocery store and shop did not have a 
‘strategy’ that we could write down. I rephrased the question – why do you visit the grocery 
store, local shop, or the weekly market? Which place is most exciting for you? This brought 
new energy to children’s responses. The points they shared were scattered, but I was able to 
write them down in this way: 
After listing these items, it was clear that the children were most excited about going to the 
weekly market as they purchased many things from there. Some children got to visit the 
local shop as well, but they did not get to buy anything for themselves except some choco-
late. Almost every child went to the grocery store in their street every day and spent 1-5 
rupees on eatables. Once this was clear, I was able to extend the discussion to the marketing 
strategies we wanted to find out. I asked if their local shopkeeper always had murukku and 
eggs. All the children immediately agreed that the man always had all the snacks they 
wanted in stock. They also pointed out that the shopkeeper was the ‘ajja’ of a girl in our 
class itself. The girl told everyone that her ajja always went to the city to purchase things for 
the shop on every Thursday. Before going, her ajja would call a man in the city so that he 
could collect all the items quickly. I used this point to bring up that the marketing strategy 
for the grocery shop is then to have all the things the people would want urgently (including 
children’s favourite snacks). We continued the discussion for the next two days to find out 
the marketing strategies of the other two groups. We also went on to write our analysis as 
noted on the blackboard on drawing sheets and displayed them in the classroom.

Assessment
7.1.1.8.1 
Formative Assessment
Formative assessment and pedagogical processes are strongly interlinked. The pedagogy itself 
must include opportunities for formative assessment. This is particularly true for process capac-
ities. Continuous assessment of processes – involvement of students, participation, etc – will be 
as much a part of assessment as end products created by students. For example, the process of 
creating a class newspaper (Bal Akhbaar) or doing a project will be assessed as will the product 
itself. Case studies, imaginary situations, unfinished stories also lend themselves to assessment, 
while creating excitement among students. Task oriented assessments (e.g., plantation, kitchen 
garden) enable action on students’ part as well as assessment of their understanding and pro-
cess capacities. Methods like holding discussions, excursions and visits, simple projects, partici-
pation in the class, group activities, also present opportunities for formative assessments. 
Rubrics are an important way of assessing learning outcomes, particularly those related to the 
pedagogical approaches mentioned above. They are a way to make assessment more objective 
and remove possible bias. Therefore, criteria and indicators for assessment need to be developed 
for assessment of group and project work. For example,
a. Content: what kind of content is being presented; what kind of data/ information has been 
collected and how has it been analysed; how effectively is the content being presented
b. Sensitivity: do student listen to peers’ responses; do they collaborate with others
c. Learning: what have they learnt with reference to the Competencies/Learning Outcomes
Formative assessment of approaches like project work (whether individual or collaborative) will 
require assessment of the process through active engagement of the Teacher in the process as 
well as assessment of the end project.
Recording of formative assessment can be done in various ways. The approach should be to min-
imize the load on the Teacher while maintaining records. For example, self-assessment with 
Teacher’s comments, student portfolio, checklists indicating attainment of Learning Outcomes, 
products of students’ creative work. 
Box B-7.1-vi 
Formative Assessment: Illustrative Questions
Throughout the process of formative assessment, the Teacher should focus and record their 
observations about student’s learning level using a few indicators. For example, 
a. Students can understand instructions and questions 
b. Students can express their experiences in class
c. Students are engaged actively in group work, cooperating with others, and taking 
support from others
355

d. Students can apply knowledge in their day-to-day tasks 
e. Students are connecting concepts with their experiences and being empathetic towards 
others
f. Students are asking questions and listening to others’ responses
Imaginary situations- The Teacher will start the discussion from sharing her recent 
experiences while travelling, such as – ‘I was travelling back home and saw a cow that was 
trying to drink water from a handpump. Suddenly, I stopped to think about what I could do 
to help the cow. What would you do if you were in my situation?’
7.1.1.8.2 
Summative Assessment
Teachers must do periodic analysis of students’ records – how learning is progressing and what 
kind of scaffolding is required. Summative assessment is useful for this; while not part of the 
regular routine of the classroom, summative assessment must also be aligned to pedagogy and 
learning outcomes.
Design of summative assessment must be such that it assesses the range of concepts and process 
capacities, and will be used to improve the development process, and not for labelling.

Teachers
We need Teachers who have specific capacities; illustratively, pedagogical approaches informed 
by understanding of context, of students’ ability to evolve understanding among learners through 
discussion, ability to use multiple methods; capacities like observation, experimentation; to con-
nect beyond specific themes; environmental awareness and sensitivity; and so on.
Until pre-service programmes prepare Teachers with these competencies in the context of World 
Around Us, Teachers of Science and Social Science must undergo in-service modules for the 
teaching of ‘World Around Us’. Either can then take up this subject at the Preparatory Stage.

Worksheets on Work Distribution
While schools were running regularly, I would use worksheets with students based on need. 
However, during monsoons, I could only engage with my students a few times a week, and 
that too for only 1-2 hours. During this time, I began to design and use different types of 
worksheets. Although I created worksheets for language and mathematics as well, I noticed 
that my Grade 5 students enjoyed the EVS worksheets the most. I also noticed that the 
reason for this was that at this time, I was meeting the students in their village, in their own 
mohallas. All the topics we usually covered inside the classroom, like listing the types of 
animals, or discussing the types of crops grown in different seasons – all of this was right 
there, around us. One such worksheet I developed was for the theme ‘Home and Family’ to 
understand the division of labour in our family: 
Students filled the worksheet within 10 minutes. After this, we held a discussion where I 
asked questions around who they thought did the most amount of work in their house. Most 
of the students’ initial response was ‘father’. Using their responses on this worksheet, we 
were able to carry the discussion further to identify that the mother in each family is 
responsible for most of the chores inside the house. The additional advantage was that this 
discussion was happening in their mohallas where several students’ mothers were perform-
ing the tasks they had written down. I observed and took note of how students also noticed 
this and changed their responses.

with Science and Social Science
At this Stage, concepts related to Environmental Education are integrated into Science and Social 
Science. This is to ensure adequate focus on the development of key concepts related to Environ-
mental Education. 
Competencies leading to the attainment of the following Curricular Goals in Science cater to the 
development of concepts related to Environmental Education – 
CG-3 
Explores the living world around us, and its interaction with the inanimate world in  
  
scientific terms
CG-6 
Explores the nature and processes of science through engaging with the evolution of  
  
scientific knowledge and conducting scientific inquiry 
Competencies leading to the attainment of the following Curricular Goals in Social Science cater 
to the development of concepts related to Environmental Education – 
CG-5 
Understands the spatial distribution of resources (from local to global), their 
  
conservation and the interdependence between natural phenomena and human life 
CG-9 
Understands the process of economic activities (production, trade, and commerce)  
  
and its impact on shaping an individual’s life as well as its influence on any country’s  
  
history and geography
7.1.3 Secondary Stage: Grades 9 and 10
Students in the Secondary Stage must be able to (i) synthesise their understanding of concepts 
related to Environmental Education from Science and Social Science to develop  a holistic under-
standing; (ii) be able to examine concepts and issues related to Environmental Education from 
multiple perspectives; (iii) view Environmental Education from the perspective  of a social-eco-
logical system framework, as opposed to a pure science perspective; (iv) examine ethical and 
moral questions that arise from this perspective; and (v) be able to engage with authentic and 
updated information and news related to environmental issues and concerns.

Social-ecological system framework: A social-ecological system framework provides a 
useful conceptual frame for understanding the interlinkages between society and nature 
that have implications for sustainability. The framework lays emphasis on interdisciplinari-
ty, integrating conceptual frameworks and methods from the natural and social sciences for 
a holistic understanding of sustainability challenges. Central to the social-ecological system 
framework are ideas of equity, environmental justice, and human well-being, fundamental 
to the development of sustainable societies.
358
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
7.1.3.1 
Grade 9: Individuals in Society, and Integration with Science and  
  
Social Science
The Interdisciplinary Areas in Grade 9 will include Individuals in Society, which will, among oth-
er things, help students develop the capacity for ethical and moral reasoning, to identify authen-
tic sources, take a position based on logic, reason and evidence, and communicate this position. 
These capacities are critical, given the growing realization that issues and concerns related to the 
environment are not simply matters of science, but require taking ethical and moral positions 
based on understanding that must be constantly renewed.
The school curriculum through all stages aims to develop values and dispositions mentioned in 
the NEP 2020. While their development is critical, it is equally important that they inform the 
thinking and actions of students. Therefore, students will develop ethical and moral reasoning, 
through engaging with socio-cultural, economic political and environmental issues/events in the 
context of current affairs. 
At the same time, students will continue to develop their understanding of concepts related to 
Environmental Education in Science and Social Science in the Secondary Stage.
Competencies related to Environmental Education in Science are developed through the Curric-
ular Goal for Grades 9 and 10.
CG-4 
Explores interconnectedness between organisms and their environment
Competencies related to Environmental Education in Social Science are developed through the 
Curricular Goals for Grades 9 and 10.

physical environment and how that influences the livelihoods, cultural diversity, and 
  
biodiversity of the region  
7.1.3.2 
Grade 10: Environmental Education 
In Grade 10, students will engage with Environmental Education as a separate subject. They will 
focus on a holistic understanding of key concerns and issues related to Environmental Education 
through drawing upon their understanding across areas, and the capacities developed in 
Grade 9.
At this Stage, students will deepen their environmental knowledge, assess issues, and analyse 
their causes across various areas, make informed judgements on statements and debates in me-
dia and society, and use a range of techniques developed in earlier grades to investigate, analyse, 
synthesize, question, critique, and draw their own conclusions. They will use multiple perspec-
tives to develop an integrated understanding, and advocate actions at multiple levels. 
While it is important at this stage that students acquire a conceptual understanding of environ-
mental issues and challenges, as well as an appreciation of the magnitude of the problem, it is 
equally important to ensure they do not get discouraged or despair for their future. The intent is 
not to scare students or pinpoint responsibility on them to respond to this crisis. Therefore, the 
presentation of alternatives through examples of actions taken to reverse or at least contain en-
vironmental damage must be ensured. At the same time, it is important to emphasize that the 
359
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
onus for mitigation is not on the individual but on communities of individuals.
7.1.3.2.1 
Aims of Environmental Education
It is critical for all students to be prepared to engage with environmental issues in adult life – 
they must have an understanding of basic issues, and a framework related to how to approach 
these issues. Therefore, at the Secondary Stage, relevant concepts must be brought together to 
enable students to develop this understanding as well as develop a personal framework to re-
spond to emerging environmental issues.
The aims of Environmental Education are:
a. Environmental literacy: Students develop environmental values, dispositions, and capaci-
ties to investigate the environment, and make intelligent, informed decisions about individ-
ual and collective work towards solutions of current problems and the prevention of new 
ones. Students are motivated and committed to transforming lives and society by acquiring 
the necessary knowledge, values and dispositions, attitudes, commitment, and capacities.
b. Social-ecological connect: Students develop awareness of and concern about interdepen-
dence between the natural and humanmade environments and the various dimensions2 of 
human societies. They also appreciate the need for balance between the environment and 
human society.
7.1.3.2.2 
Nature of Knowledge
Current environmental problems must be seen as comprising many aspects. They involve issues 
of public health, social justice, behaviour towards nature, and ignorance about matters of sci-
ence, policy, rights, and ethics – they must therefore be examined through the lens of multiple 
disciplines and perspectives. 
a. The knowledge base for Environmental Education comes from both research and practice. 
Environmental Education draws from many different fields such as biology, ecology, 
geography, chemistry, geology, physics, economics, sociology, natural resources, agriculture, 
management, law, and politics.
b. Environmental Education critically addresses both social and natural concerns. Social 
concerns include issues of gender and marginalization, equity, justice and respect for 
human dignity and rights. It also encourages students to develop knowledge about 
indigenous practices for prevention of environmental degradation. Natural concerns 
include issues related to survival of animal species and sustainable use of resources, like 
forests, rivers, etc. Therefore, Environmental Education enables in students a well-
developed set of environmental values as well as the capacity to participate and initiate 
actions in order to remediate or prevent further environmental issues and sustainability. 
2 
 Economic, socio-cultural, political, historical, ethical, and aesthetic dimensions
360
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Box B-7.1-ix 
Environmental values include but are not limited to aesthetic appreciation of beauty of 
surroundings including diversity of physical and socio-cultural environment; sensitivity 
towards social, political, economic, cultural, and natural environment and phenomena; 
ability and motivation to identify and raise questions related to human dignity, justice, and 
rights.
c. Environmental Education helps imagine a sustainable future for all wherein environmental 
and social responsibility drive individual and group choices. It goes beyond resource 
conservation and habitat preservation to focus on environmental literacy. It also examines 
how economic growth and environmental protection should go side by side.
Box B-7.1-x 
 
Environmental literacy prepares students for active participation in dealing with environ-
mental issues. An environmentally literate person is someone who, individually and together 
with others, makes informed decisions concerning the environment; is willing to act on these 
decisions to improve the well-being of other individuals, societies, and the global environ-
ment; and participates in civic life. Environmentally literate individuals possess the knowl-
edge and understanding of a wide range of environmental concepts, problems, and issues; 
along with the cognitive capacities and abilities as well as dispositions and values that 
enable environmentally responsible behavioural strategies to apply such knowledge and 
understanding in order to make sound and effective decisions in a range of environmental 
contexts. It requires going beyond fragmented thinking about the environment and thinking 
in terms of interaction of human and natural systems. The production of environmentally 
literate citizens through formal education will enable the knowledge, cognitive capacities, 
and attitudes acquired in the classroom, to be transferred to the decision-making process of 
students throughout their lives.
d. Environmental Education examines the natural world and human societies as systems with 
complex realities that constantly interact with each other. It explores causes for imbalance 
across these systems through the interdependence among the components of the system 
comprising the natural and human environment and the various dimensions of human 
society.
e. Environmental Education provides the opportunity to critically explore and analyse the 
co-existence of multiple truths and realities. It offers multiple interpretations of any 
situation or event which must converge into equitable, just, and sustainable solutions. For  
example, the tensions created by the need for development, and for preservation of the 
environment.

Subject-Specific Challenges
So far, Environmental Education, integrated with Science and Social Science, has been focused on 
facts. Students have been able to examine concepts related to the environment from either the 
lens of Science or Social Science. They have not been able to get a holistic view of environmental 
concerns. Another challenge is that till now, environmental literacy has not been the focus – 
which is the need of the hour.
At the Secondary Stage, Environmental Education will be offered as a separate subject for the 
first time. Till it is offered as a specialization in Teacher education programmes, the greatest 
challenge will be to identify Teachers. 
In the interim, capacity building of these Teachers will also require academic support institu-
tions to develop their own capacity in the subject.
7.1.3.2.4 
Learning Standards
All students must to be aware of what is happening around them related to Environmental Edu-
cation, to be able to advocate and participate in necessary action. These Learning Standards are 
intended to develop the environmental understanding necessary in all citizens, as well as the 
methods and capacities they must employ as ordinary citizens (e.g., problem identification, caus-
es, future impact visualization, prediction, policy actions and society actions as well as actions at 
the level of individuals, ability to critique systemic actions, and so on).

Content
a. Principles of Content Selection 
The following principles must inform content selection for Environmental Education at the 
Secondary Stage.
i. 
Content must reflect global perspectives, and reflect actions of nations, individuals, 
bodies/institutions; it must develop the belief that collaborative and sustained global 
solutions are needed. For example, 
1) Scientific basis of climate system and climate change; causes for and effect of 
biodiversity collapse; causes and impact of pollution; interrelationship between 
them
2) Vulnerability of socio-economic and natural systems to climate change, 
consequences of climate change and options for adapting to it
3) Use of natural resources like petrol across the globe and how it has affected 
economies and cultures; loss of glacial ice; climate change – rising sea levels; 
flooding due to heavy rains; soil erosion in islands; shrinking of rivers
363
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
4) Measures taken to address these changes and sustainable practices
5) Global efforts towards mitigation of/adaptation to climate change – United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change; Kyoto Protocol (carbon credits, 
Emissions Reduction Purchase Agreement); Conferences of Parties; Cancun 
Agreement, Durban Platform for Enhanced Action
ii. Content must present strong qualitative case studies and quantitative data that indicate 
the impact of events and phenomenon, and enable analysis of contemporary impact. 
They should enable a holistic study, through offering multiple perspectives, and include 
stories of successful transformations. These case studies should be local – which can be 
selected by the State curriculum developers or even Teachers, national and 
international For example, 
1) Jal Jeevan and projects to clean rivers, Swachchta Abhiyaan
2) Sustainable homes with natural materials and cooling/heating systems in India
3) Astrotourism for sustainable rural development in Ladakh and Africa
4) Developmental needs versus conservation of environment
5) Disposal of e-waste, biowaste, medical waste (including radioactive materials)
6) Case studies of work and impact of grassroots individuals and organisations
iii. Content should represent inter- and intra-nation ethical dilemmas and conflicts related 
to environment and cultures/ countries, as well as indicate how these have been/can 
be resolved. For example,
1) Sharing of river waters
2) Carbon credits/offsets
3) Displacement, environment refugees
4) Benefits for privileged groups versus vulnerable groups
5) Shrinking space for animals, leading to human-animal conflict
iv. Content should incorporate Indian and local knowledge. It must engage the student 
with indigenous knowledge, and enable them to present their analysis and findings 
through different mediums. For example, 
1) Cropping patterns
2) Reviving lost crops
3) Sustainable practices that have both evolved historically and been lost in the 
country such as drainage, cooling, water systems; cultural traditions related to 
agriculture, forests, flora, and fauna
4) Baolis, sacred groves, etc
5) Organic agriculture 
v. Content must enable school-based actions. It should enable advocacy at different levels 
and through different means. For example, 
1) Use of creative media that can enable recording of environmental issues, challenges, 
and positive actions and stories (e.g. videos)
364
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
2) Development of materials (newsletter, scripts for motivation, articles), etc. for 
dissemination in the community
vi. Content must enable informed and well-researched group discussions and debate. 
Debates that are topical and pertinent should be included – particularly around 
balancing development with preservation of the environment. For example, 
1) Older and contemporary environmental debates; development versus 
environmental preservation; movement from cities for sustainable living
Teacher’s Voice B-7.1-iii[To be Edited] 
Content
When I think about what I want students to learn about the environment, I realise the 
question is difficult. They must be aware of the danger the world is in because of environ-
mental degradation. However, the future seems so dismal that I don’t want them to think 
that their lives hold no hope. My responsibility deepens because of this dilemma.
I plan to share the realities of the triple planetary crisis with them but also provide them 
with details of initiatives taken by individuals and communities to make small changes that 
have positive impacts on the environment. I also want to help them develop a sense of how 
to respond as members of a community to decisions and policies made by governments 
related to the environment.
I think the best way to achieve these goals is to give them detailed case studies to read. 
These case studies must help students understand not only the context and specific issues, 
but also actions taken to address these issues. There are several instances in our country of 
people who have revived traditional practices of conservation or used simple technology to 
devise solutions and alternatives. Reading these case studies will help students to not only 
adopt a positive, solution-oriented attitude, it will also help them see how communities can 
take action at a local level.
b. Recommended approach 
Students will take up specific issues and examine their impact using an interdisciplinary 
lens. They will discuss impact and mitigation of these environmental issues. While the 
approach can be varied, it is recommended that the triple planetary crisis – biodiversity 
collapse, pollution, climate change – comprise the themes to be taken up during the Second-
ary stage. 
To ensure a holistic understanding of all aspects with the required depth, it is recommend-
ed that experiential leaning be enabled through using case studies, site exploration, proj-
ects, guided readings, and other similar approaches. Whichever approach is taken, students 
should be able to examine the issue locally, and then extend their understanding into 
regional, national, and international concerns and actions. The underlying principle is to 
provide evidence-based understanding of both the crisis and its mitigation. Another princi-
ple is to ensure a holistic understanding as opposed to a fragmented understanding of 
perspectives from science, social science, human rights, politics, ethics, and justice. This 
365
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
principle is operationalised through approaching the content using a social-ecological 
systems framework. 
The three selected themes – biodiversity collapse, pollution, climate change – are central to 
the current planetary crisis and provide a comprehensive understanding of issues as well as 
mitigation. It may be important to highlight other issues as well. However, it is strongly 
recommended that the approach given below is followed. This approach balances all 
aspects while providing a comprehensive understanding of local and regional issues.
i. 
Students should be able to gain an understanding of the key issues related  to each of 
the three themes though case studies, guided readings, site explorations, projects, and 
similar approaches. 
ii. Preferably, the content should be contextual (located in the community, region or State 
the school is located in). If this is not possible, it must be ensured that at least a part of 
content students engage with is contextual.
iii. Content being used should offer rigour while being simple. Teachers should refer to 
similar issues (which can be included in the textbook) to ensure a broader 
understanding.

7.1.3.2.6 
Pedagogy
As students move into the Secondary Stage, their ability for logical and abstract thinking devel-
ops further. They can independently deepen their environmental knowledge, assess, and analyse 
issues comprehensively. They make informed judgements on statements and debates in media 
and society, and use a wide range of techniques to investigate, analyse, synthesize, question, cri-
tique, and draw their own conclusions. 
Using the essential knowledge and capacities developed in earlier stages, they are able to use 
theories, models, and ideas to develop explanations and advocate actions for certain environ-
mental phenomena. 
Students show initiative, creativity, perseverance, and problem-solving capacities for environ-
mental action. They start becoming familiar with valid, reliable sources of information. At this 
stage, students can also critique existing policies and practices.
Box B-7.1-xi 
Case studies are stories or narratives that are used as a teaching tool. They typically 
present a real-world scenario, provide supporting data and documents, and present the 
central problem in an open-ended manner. Using case studies supports participatory, 
discussion-based way of learning where students gain capacities in critical thinking, 
communication, and group dynamics. It is a type of problem-based learning where 
students have the opportunity to understand the available data and explore multiple 
perspectives. It is a way for students to move beyond having to find a single solution, 
while focusing on developing ideas for possible action at different levels.
Students must examine environmental issues not only from a scientific/technological lens but 
also from the lens of the social sciences and humanities. They must examine how the actions of 
individuals, communities, and nations – both historical and contemporary – can have far-reach-
ing consequences. Pedagogy must, therefore, be informed by the following:
a. Teacher must deliberately plan for the development of environmental values and 
dispositions. They should be made explicit for students by drawing attention to 
environmental values embedded in case studies, narratives, etc.
b. Debates around historical and contemporary issues in education enable the development of 
a critical individual with the ability to take actions through critical engagement with theory 
and practice. These abilities must be developed through investigation, analysis and problem 
solving, and similar strategies, that are relevant to their own communities.
c. Students must identify how they can express their understanding in the community, 
whether through advocacy or simply through dialogue.
d. Students must get as much exposure as possible at this stage – through books, media, films, 
dialogue among peers and elders, interaction with peers from other schools, video 
conferencing through experts and peers outside the State or country. 
e. Teachers must not consider self and textbook as the only source but enable interaction with 
other persons and/or media to expand their learning. Teachers must have a resource pool 
of persons who can support learning of students. 
367
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
f. A significant platform must be provided to students to share their experiences, findings, and 
reflections (school newsletter, seminars, publications, TV interviews, social media, etc).
g. For continued learning throughout the year, students can take up a project or participate in 
an ongoing project (cleaning rivers, community projects, sustainable school practices, green 
school).
h. Students must be encouraged to read materials on the environment, and present synthesis 
of readings; reviews of relevant books and films, videos, programmes, and reflections can 
also be shared.
7.1.3.2.7 
Assessment
a. Formative Assessment
The following principles must inform assessment:
i. 
Since environmental issues have multiple interpretations, assessment should be open 
ended, to evaluate the ability of the student to argue logically and take a stand. 
ii. Another principle governing assessment will be to test for students’ knowledge and 
understanding of local history, resources, and government along with its connection to 
national/global context. 
iii. As students’ engagement with more abstract ideas and the larger world increases, 
assessment of change in students’ understanding as reflected in their writing, day-to-
day activities, planning, etc. must be included in assessment. 
iv. At this stage, debates, discussion, dialogue, case studies are a part of pedagogy. Hence, 
formative assessment must be done through observation of students, review of their 
work, and analysis of their contributions to discussions.
v. This will be possible through the use of clearly stated criteria and rubrics. These must 
be shared with students beforehand, so they are clear of the expectations from them.
Box B-7.1-xii 
Illustration of formative assessment using case studies
Case study: Due to human pressure and excessive exploitation, forests are shrinking rapidly. 
While trees are being cut indiscriminately for the projects being made for development, 
there are some people across the country who are making serious efforts to save and 
increase their forests. Due to their efforts, greenery is returning to the earth even in a very 
limited area.
Jagat Singh Janglee, a resident of Kotmalla village of Rudraprayag, Uttarakhand, is one 
example of such efforts by working on mixed forests for four decades. There are more than 
five lakh trees of more than 70 species like Deodar, Kail, Kafal, Oak, Thuner, Chir in the 
mixed forest prepared in an area of more than 3 hectares. Apart from this, he has grown 
many rare species of plants like Kedar Patti, Cardamom, Brahmi. 
368
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Jagat Singh Janglee believes that we have to place continuous efforts to generate moisture. 
For this, instead of trees of only one species, we need to make a mixed forest with mixed 
species of trees, creepers, tubers etc. Such efforts will bring local and global advantages. At 
the local level, fodder, wood and essential forest material will be available. At a global level, 
the rising temperatures on earth due to global warming will get access to clean air and 
moisture. Such efforts will also bring additional improvements such as maintaining the 
ground water level.
Table B-7.2-viii
Criteria for assessment and method of assessment
Content 
Content can be assessed based on the student’s understanding of the given case 
study through various questions:
a. What kind of forest has Jagat Singh Janglee developed?
b. What would be the benefit of developing such a forest?
Process
Process can be assessed based on group tasks, discussions, and presentations 
with a few questions, such as:
a. Collect information about people around you/find out about people who are 
making similar efforts and record how their efforts are helping in environmen-
tal protection.
Expression
Expression of what the student has learnt from the content and process will be 
articulated in written and oral form, such as:
a. Write a case study around an instance of sustainable development by an 
individual or community known to you.
b. Can we develop a mixed forest in the school by planting a variety of local 
plants in the flowerbed of our school?
c. Debate what type of policy recommendations can be made based on the 
impact of such efforts to counter biodiversity collapse
Views
a. Do you think a single person’s efforts are adequate to prevent biodiversity 
collapse? Why? Why not?
b. Summative Assessment
i. 
Summative assessment will be done on the completion of projects, reports on 
experiences, etc.
ii. Students could be asked to write essays on environmental issues. Broad-based 
questions that assess the understanding of students based on the social-ecological 
system framework should be used to provide students anchors for writing these essays.
iii. In case of paper-pencil tests, it is recommended that questions largely be based on case 
studies, and analysis of documents. While some MCQs can be included, short essays 
assessed through rubrics shared with students will allow for a comprehensive 
assessment.

Teachers
Currently, there are hardly any courses on environmental education, and none that prepare 
Teachers. In the current scenario, it would be difficult to expect that a separate set of Teachers 
will be recruited for environmental education. However, this will change once departments of 
education begin to offer specialization in Environmental Education during pre-service Teacher 
education. 
Until then, it is entirely possible to develop some of the critical capacities in both pre-and in-ser-
vice Teacher education programmes.
The following must be done in the interim:
a. Preferably, Teachers of Science will undergo in-service modules for the teaching of 
Environmental Education at the Secondary Stage. In case a Science Teacher is not available 
for some reasons, Teachers of Social Science will have to be prepared for teaching 
Environmental Education.
b. The pre-service curriculum must have Environmental Education as a compulsory 
component. Student Teachers can also undertake projects and small research studies 
related to Environmental Education aligned to those expected from school students.
c. Guidelines for modules and courses will be included in the National Curriculum Framework 
for Teacher Education
Box B-7.1-xiii 
At the Secondary Stage, the Science Teacher should handle Environmental Education, as 
content at this Stage would suit the understanding a Science Teacher has. If the Science 
Teacher is not available, the Social Science Teacher can take up this subject. However, both 
the Science and Social Science Teacher should prioritize attainment of the Competencies for 
the subject as given for the Secondary Stage. The Teacher should be cautious to not place 
overemphasis on content or capacities that are more aligned to their subject of specializa-
tion. The Teacher of Environmental Education should combine relevant understanding of 
both Science and Social Science at the school level, and be able to draw linkages between 
the two in the context of the subject.

Section 7.2 
Individuals in Society (Grade 9)
Ethical and moral reasoning involves thinking about fundamental questions related to everyday 
events – What is right or wrong? Can right or wrong be identified? What actions are justified? 
What is the ‘right’ thing to do? What are the reasons that justify the ‘right’ thing? This kind of 
reasoning is necessary for responding rationally to situations, instead of impulsively or instinc-
tively. 
For example, the instinctive reaction to a dangerous situation is to safeguard oneself. But the 
process of ethical and moral reasoning enables determining the right actions, not only for one-
self but also for others in the same situation. These questions are equally applicable across com-
mon instances we encounter in real life. For example, will a road bring prosperity to a village or 
will it degrade the natural environment, and bring undesirable elements into the community? 
Will tourism alleviate poverty in a region or will it permanently change the area and its inhabi-
tants? Can a war be just if it fought to protect the interests of the disadvantaged? 
The response to these questions requires systematic reasoning. 
a. First of all, it requires an awareness of events – the context, the factors affecting it, people 
involved. 
b. Second, it requires identification of ethical and moral questions – whether there is violation 
of basic human and Constitutional values or any danger of the well-being and/or rights of 
any individual or community being affected. 
c. Third, identify arguments for and against possible actions. 
d. Fourth, deciding what the ‘right’ thing to do, what is the evidence for making this claim, and 
how the action(s) be carried out. 
e. Finally, identifying possible consequences of the proposed actions, and what other steps can 
be taken to counter these.
These capacities cannot be developed in a vacuum. While students encounter such ethical and 
moral questions in other curricular areas, socio-cultural, economic and political issues, and cur-
rent affairs are best suited to meet the aim of developing them. 
Ethical and moral reasoning in the context of socio-cultural, economic and political issues, and 
current affairs requires the application of understanding gained from multiple subjects, as well 
as the moral and ethical values that are developed as a part of other curricular areas. Therefore, 
this subject is a part of the Interdisciplinary Areas. 
7.2.1 Aims of Individuals in Society
Engagement with current affairs is an end in itself. To quote the DNEP 2019, ‘The knowledge that 
schools impart to students is not an end in itself, but a means to a better and more meaningful and 
purposeful life in the future. In particular, since possible future endeavours and occupations to be 
taken up after school or university are dictated by the realities of the evolving world around us, we 
must encourage a constant connect between the classroom and the real world, and not isolate the 
two’. (Introduction to Section 4.6.10). 
371
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
The aim of this subject is to enable students to: 
a. Use ethical and moral reasoning to engage with issues/events: Students identify key 
ethical and moral questions based on a comprehensive understanding of an issue or events. 
They take an informed position based on evidence and reason and advocate suitable action 
in a democratic manner. 
b. Develop an interest in and ability to engage with current affairs: Students develop the 
habit of keeping abreast with current affairs at the local, district, state, national and interna-
tional level. They use understanding from across disciplinary areas, and ethical and moral 
reasoning to examine current affairs. They take informed positions based on evidence and 
reason and advocate suitable action in a democratic manner. 
7.2.2 Nature of Knowledge
The knowledge base of Individuals in Society is interdisciplinary, and rooted in understanding, 
and values and dispositions developed across curricular areas.
a. A comprehensive understanding is required to be able to decide what is ethical and moral, 
and to evaluate actions. This also requires being able to apply understanding, and values 
and dispositions from other disciplinary areas, to understand issues and events 
comprehensively. An understanding of events in the local community, state, nation and 
world in terms of priorities and concerns, as well along multiple dimensions – social, moral, 
ethical, political, economic – comprises this comprehensive understanding.
b. This comprehensive understanding enables individuals to take a view or position, and/or 
recommend and participate in a set of actions that will bring positive change. It also enables 
recognition of what can be done through actions as a group within the community and 
being able to identify what is in the purview of policy and governance. 
c. There are no fixed answers – different interpretations and actions are correct when seen 
from different perspectives, or when placed in different contexts. 
7.2.3 Current Challenges
The major challenge is systemic readiness – our teachers have no prior experience or expertise, 
nor is there a pre-existing body of knowledge related to the area. The following are the concerns 
that must be kept in mind: 
a. Teachers must have a high degree of awareness related to current affairs, and they must 
be able to guide students through the process of learning how to engage with issues and 
events from an ethical-moral lens. 
b. Content of Individuals in Society must be dynamic – current affairs are changing and 
influenced by multiple factors. 
c. Some questions are likely to remain ‘open’ – there may not be any conclusive solutions 
or even agreement because of the nature of the subject. 
372
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
d. Pupil-teacher ratio needs to be reasonable for transaction of this subject since it requires 
students to be very active, and for teachers to scaffold them. 
e. Teachers may avoid taking up certain issues and events they feel are ‘sensitive’, particu-
larly if they are local. This may lead to the exclusion specifically of issues like caste, class, 
gender. 
7.2.4 Learning Standards
Curricular goals are intended to help student develop the ability to use ethical and moral reason-
ing in the context of current affairs.

7.2.5 Content
To meet the curricular goals, the content must draw from all the important domains of individu-
al participation in larger society. While these domains can be categorised as socio-cultural, eco-
nomic, and political, specific focus on the environment is also necessary. Therefore, students 
must gain adequate exposure to issues/events within all the following domains: 
a. Socio-cultural domain
b. Economic domain 
c. Political domain
d. Environment
374
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
All issues/events will fall primarily within these domains. At the same time, these domains are 
not watertight – some issues/events may have dimensions falling within one or more of the do-
mains. 
7.2.5.1 
Principles of Content Selection 
Two sets of content will be required for this subject. 
a. Content to develop capacity to examine current affairs
The purpose of the first set will be to help students engage with specific issues/events that 
reflect larger concerns, which may have been persisting for a long time (even centuries), 
through case studies, short films, documents, etc. 
The reason for the inclusion of this content is to simulate the process of exploring multiple 
perspectives, identifying issues/events that are core, the debates that arose, and how they 
were resolved or remain yet to be resolved. Students will be able to understand the long-
term consequences of these events, and appreciate the importance of taking moral and ethi-
cal positions. This content will help them strengthen their own values and principles, and 
also help them experience the process of reasoning that is necessary for taking an informed 
position. 
The principles that will inform the selection of this content are: 
i. 
Multidimensional and well-documented issue/event: Sufficient content should be 
available, with information, opinion pieces, data, debates, news reports, and similar  
material, to enable an understanding of multiple perspectives. 
ii. Concerning several moral and ethical questions: The content should make these 
moral and ethical questions explicit, and offer well rounded arguments based on 
evidence and reasoning for responding to each of these questions. 
iii. Persisting over a long period, with efforts for change: There should be a sufficient 
record of actions, and their consequences, of positive changes. There should be scope to 
examine different perspectives for change, and the consequences of these changes. 
iv. Recent but critical, hence multiple efforts ongoing: Even if the matter under 
discussion is not recent, there should be sufficient material to make ethical and moral 
questions, and how they have been addressed explicit (e.g. concerns related to the 
environment).
Illustratively, gender inequality, caste, unequal access to resources, debates related to role 
science and technology,  political participation, environmental concerns could be some areas 
around which materials could be made available.
b. Current affairs
The second set of content is related to current affairs. This set will be dynamic – it will be 
selected by the teacher and students based on their interest in current affairs. This content 
will integrate the learning of students in several curricular areas, and help them apply the 
capacities developed through engaging with the first set of content. It will comprise two 
kinds of content – (i) news reports, articles, clippings of TV news, YouTube videos, data, etc, 
375
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
and (ii) interviews with community members, reports of surveys within the community, etc. 
The reason for inclusion of this content is to develop among students the interest and under-
standing to engage with current affairs. 
The following set of principles will inform this choice: 
i. 
Cover all four domains: Content should be related to all four domains. Illustratively, 
1) Content from the socio-cultural domain could be around gender, caste, class, sports, 
media.
2) Content from the economic domain could be around public investment, poverty, 
employment, schemes.
3) Content from the political domain could be around rights and duties, civic 
engagement, democratic processes, public crime, safety and security.
4) Content from the environment domain could be around health and hygiene, climate 
change, pollution, biodiversity.
ii. Multiple dimensions: Content should enable students to engage with different 
dimensions. This kind of content allows greater scope for ethical and moral reasoning. 
Illustratively, 
1) Whether the decision of road construction in a village will lead to better economic 
opportunities or bring undesirable changes to the lifestyle of the community.
iii. Students can relate to the issue/event: Content should be close to the students’ life 
and experiences, and current learning across disciplines. Illustratively, 
1) Students may find it difficult to relate to mass shootings in other countries. On the 
other hand, effect of long-term use of chemical fertilizers can be taken up easily in a 
rural setting, and rich-poor divide in urban settings.  
iv. Content should not ignite extreme views or passions: Content selected should not 
lead to confrontation among students or lead to backlash from the community. 
Illustratively,
2) Content that touches religious sentiment. 
3) Content related to an area that has already polarised communities, and is likely to 
excite passions.  
v. Content should be of various kinds: digital, text, readings, opinion piece, newspaper 
reports, Parliamentary debates, research reports, data, as well as discussion with 
community members. 
vi. Authenticity of content must be confirmed: In this age of information overload, and 
fake news, it must be ensured the material is from a reliable and valid source. 
Illustratively, content must be from 
1) Reliable magazines and newspapers/their websites
2) Videos of acknowledged experts in the field
3) Websites of reliable agencies or government departments or institutions/ 
universities

7.2.6 Pedagogy
The curricular goals of this area will be best met through giving students the opportunity to en-
gage with different content in different ways. 
To this end, the pedagogical principles should be:
a. Model process of ethical and moral reasoning: Students must be supported through the 
process of engaging with an issue/event before they work independently. This must be 
done through a set of questions and ongoing discussions to help them examine content 
from different perspectives. The process itself – how students engaged with content, how 
they identified what was important, how it made them feel, what were the questions they 
felt the need to reflect on/discuss, how they looked for answers to these questions, were 
they satisfied with the answers, how did they choose a view/opinion and why  – must be 
discussed. 
b. Encourage students to look for additional information: Students must be encouraged to 
look for information to answer any questions they may have, or for supplementary materi-
als. Illustratively, they can ask community members, teachers, any experts they know, or 
they can visit the local library, search the Internet.
c. Independent and group tasks: Students should engage with as much content as possible, 
and different kinds of content. They should explore this content independently or in groups.
d. Communication of learning and opinions: Students must present not only learning but 
also their opinions on what they have read. For example, if they have read a case study on 
biodiversity collapse, they must present both what they have learnt, and also their opinions 
on how this collapse can be managed in their locality.
e. Opportunities for debate and discussions: Students must have the opportunity to 
present opinions that may differ, and learn the process of listening to each other, put forth 
well thought-through arguments, and be able to ‘agree to disagree’.

Mission to Mars
One of my students brought a newspaper clipping on a manned mission to Mars to class. I 
asked her to read it out to the other students. There was a lot of excitement – I have tried to 
capture the conversation below.
Student A: ‘I don’t think humans can live on Mars! In our science class, Madam was saying 
that the conditions on Mars are not alright for human life.’ 
Student B: ‘They will not be able to live like we do on Earth! They will have to live inside 
something like tents. But how will the tents be kept cool? How will they get water? How will 
they get electricity?’
Student C: ‘The report says it will take 7 months to reach Mars. What is an astronaut gets 
sick on the way? Will they come back? Even if doctors are on board, what if they need 
specialised equipment?’
Student A: ‘The report says the trip will cost billions of dollars. That is many 100 crores of 
rupees!’
Student D: ‘Don’t we have many other things to spend the money on? And the astronauts 
will be in danger. And what will they do in Mars?’
Student E: ‘But going to Mars is like travelling on the seas was for ancient travellers! If they 
had thought about dangers and stayed at home, imagine what the world would  be like! 
Maybe we wouldn’t have invented airplanes because everyone was happy to stay at home.’
At this point, I thought this would be a good area to explore. I asked students – ‘What if we 
try to answer the question: Is a manned mission to Mars important for mankind?’
The students were excited about the idea. I asked them to think about the following ques-
tions, and any other they can think of – 
a. What is the manned mission to Mars? Who has planned it? Why has it been planned? 
Who is paying for it? Who will be going on this mission? When is it expected to take off? 
What are the challenges?  Any other questions?
b. Do you see any challenges related to the well-being of the astronauts? How will they and 
their families deal with the separation? Will their sacrifice be worth it? Can the money 
being spent on this mission be used elsewhere to improve human existence?  We have 
seen that human entry into space has created space debris – has space exploration 
affected the environment in any other way? Any other questions?
c. What are the arguments for and against a manned mission to Mars? Any other 
questions?
d. What do you think in the right thing to do? Why do you feel this is the right thing?  Any 
other questions?
e. What will happen if your position is accepted? What will be the results? Are there any 
other steps that can be taken? Any other questions?

7.2.6.1 
Recommended Approach
The following approach is recommended for Individuals in Society. The table below indicates the 
approach and the key expected outcomes, as well as the recommended pedagogy. 
Table B-7.2-iii
Approach
Pedagogy
1.
Discussing larger socio-cultural, economic 
and political issues/events to simulate the 
process of engaging with current affairs, and 
using ethical and moral reasoning. 
Key outcomes: (i) an understanding of how to 
approach an event/issue, (ii) an agreement on 
the key questions related to an issue/event, 
(iii) steps involved in building a position, (iv) 
ability to put forth a position, and debate in a 
democratic manner.
Students engage with the materials and 
respond to a set of questions; illustratively, 
What is the context of the event/key ques-
tions? What are the central issues? What are 
the arguments for and against these key 
issues? What is your view? Why do you think 
this way? How did you reach this conclusion? 
What did you learn in school that is connect-
ed to this event/issue? Which actions do you 
think are justifiable, and why? What actions 
would you recommend?
2
Taking up small projects related to  local 
issues/events of current interest. Illustrative-
ly, seasonal migration from villages and its 
impact; how construction of road in village 
changed socio-cultural and economic chang-
es; where does all the garbage go (in cities)?  
Key outcomes: (i) identification of primary 
sources of information; (ii) application of 
learning around moral and ethical reasoning 
to a real-life experience.
Teachers support students develop a frame-
work to engage with community members or 
officials, as required. Students bring in 
information, and Teacher facilitates discus-
sion around a few key questions. 
Students could run a monthly newsletter or 
find a similar platform (morning assembly 
once a month, special time set aside monthly) 
to communicate their understanding of local 
affairs in various modes.
Illustrations of issues/events students can explore in the local community:
• Political domain- local elections, local administration, local self-governance
• Socio-cultural domain- local educational provisions, local arts and crafts, relationships in the 
community
• Economic domain– local occupations, employment opportunities, migration for work, agricultural 
practices and markets 
• Environment domain – biodiversity, conservation efforts, development in the area and its impact 
on nature
380
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education

Discussing current affairs sourced through 
newspapers, electronic and social media.
Key outcomes: (i) understanding of current 
affairs; (ii) application of learning around 
ethical and moral reasoning; (iii) ability to 
communicate in a democratic manner; (iv) 
ability to identify reliable and valid sources of 
information 
Students are divided into groups. One group 
identifies a theme related to current affairs at 
the international level, and starts collecting 
materials. Preferably, this theme should have 
been discussed over the previous month, so 
that there is sufficient material, and it is still 
current. The other groups collect related 
materials at the national and state levels.
Inputs are taken from community members, 
where relevant.
The materials used are reviewed and dis-
cussed, to determine authenticity. 
Issues/events are discussed, and then 
students communicate their positions. They 
debate these positions, share their views. 
The first step in the teaching of Individuals in Society will be to engage with larger issues/events. These 
issues/events can be detailed out in the textbooks.
Once one set of a larger issue/event has been completed, students will engage with local affairs for 
actually experiencing the process of gathering information, and processing it. Once this project is over, 
they will start identifying current affairs from newspapers and the media, and apply the processes 
learnt to this activity.
Finally, all three processes will continue, with two periods a week devoted to larger issues/events, and 
one period to current affairs.
Schools must develop a library that students can refer to, and subscribe to relevant local and national 
newspapers and periodicals. A list of websites that students can access for further exploration of current 
affairs will have to be maintained in the library. Access to the Internet, with guidelines to ensure online 
safety, will be required.

Content and pedagogy
One of my students, Archana, came into class very disturbed. Before I could ask what the 
matter was, she burst out, “The world is ending! What is the point of living!” The other 
students also got agitated, and I had to raise my voice to force them to quieten. I asked 
Archana what the matter was. She pushed a printout from towards me. I read:
Source: https://nasawatch.com/news/cnn-says-its-the-end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it/
“This is from the CNN website, so it must be true!”
382
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
I was taken aback – this was a reputed website. But I had not read the news anywhere. I 
asked the other students if they had heard anything – they all said they had not.
Nimrat said, “But it must be true if it is in the news! Everything on TV and newspapers is 
true!”
I reassured Archana and Abdul, “We must not believe everything we read – especially if we 
don’t witness such things. Let’s discuss how to get more information”.
Jagmohan suggests, “Let’s look at different websites related to science. But we must look at 
proper websites”.
Archana: “Which websites?”
Jagmohan: “ISRO website, RRI website, Vigyan Prasar, Indian Institute of Astrophysics. They 
have the equipment to get accurate data. They are also responsible institutes, so will carry 
accurate news”.
Abdul: “We should not look at only one website, but multiple websites as well as other 
sources. We must look at other sources like newspapers, and science journals. We can look 
for research papers.”
In the meantime, Archana was examining the printout. Suddenly, she said, “Look! There is a 
statement at the corner of the image – Not Vetted by CNN. We need to find out more. I have 
an Aunt who is a scientist – I will ask her”.
I said, “When any news or information comes to us, we listen to it. If someone sends a picture 
or video to us, we see it. We never think that news or information can be biased or untrue, 
and pictures and videos doctored”.
Jagmohan responded, “That is true! We must always explore further”.
I agreed and proposed the children research the news further in the next few days, so we 
could discuss it in the next class.
7.2.7 Assessment
7.2.7.1 
Formative Assessment 
Assessment of ethical and moral reasoning requires teachers to carefully observe students. As-
sessment of current affairs requires providing students different opportunities to demonstrate 
this understanding. 
Various tools and approaches could be used for assessment, like essay writing on the issue dis-
cussed; case study-based question papers with MCQs and short answer responses; group project 
work where a new topic is given, and students produce a short 2500 word paper on the topic.
Space must be provided for multiple interpretations and views. Therefore, formative assessment 
must focus not on what students are communicating, but the process by which they have reached 
their conclusions. Illustratively, a rubric could focus on:
383
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
a. Sources that students have referred to – are they of different kinds, how has the authenticity 
been ensured?
b. Identification of key ethical and moral questions – does the student have a rationale for why 
these questions have been identified?
c. Accepting of different positions – does the student listen to other points of view, is the 
student able to maintain cordial conversation after a disagreement?
d. Taking a position – is the student able to explain the reasons for taking a specific position, 
are the reasons substantiated with learning across curricular areas, and are human and 
Constitutional values referred to?
e. Interest in current affairs – does the student initiate discussion related to local news or 
news heard on media, does the student ask questions about issues/events?
f. Communication – is the identification of key issues clear, are they briefly described, can the 
student communicate orally in a dispassionate manner?
Students must not be provided any marks/grades, but a checklist can be maintained. Self and 
peer assessment are recommended, including providing constructive feedback. Teachers must 
provide students with specific feedback on how to improve. 
Students can be asked to prepare a reflective journal based on classes with weekly entries and 
submit it at the end of every month. Teachers and students must jointly review the entries.

Assessment
We have had two celebrations on women’s contribution in science this year. It has piqued 
students’ interest, but we haven’t considered it into our classroom discussions so far. During 
last week’s morning assembly, students of Grade 9 had read out a related news story of a 
statement by a Minister. In continuation with this, I decided to organize a debate: ‘Women’s 
participation in science is women-led development, not women’s development’. Students 
were divided into groups to argue for and against the statement and given a week to 
prepare. I find that while organizing a debate, my presence and observation is important 
during both, the students’ preparation and during the debate. For this, I have developed 
simple indicators to use during each debate to understand their progress across learning 
outcomes.

Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
The students arguing for the statement had identified several women scientists in history 
and during recent periods. One student who had done a detailed research had identified a 
wonderful point on how women scientists may have received limited or no recognition due 
to a common misconception that advancements in science are always big, Eureka moments. 
She focused on how the nature of science is such that each discovery matters. She had then 
used examples of male scientists who had easily received recognition as ‘game-changers’, 
which has had sociocultural and economic implications on supporting women in science. 
While sharing that this student had won the debate, I was able to articulate to the class that 
while several students had done well on each of the parameters, this student had done 
particularly well in the first parameter. Almost all the students do well on parameter 2, 3, 
and 4 as it is related to research and writing the debate. I noticed that some students 
struggle with parameter 5, as rebutting requires them to use their argument and their 
opponent’s. There are 3 students who struggle with parameter 6 and can get quite nervous 
or upset during their presentation. So, these rubrics give me a concrete understanding of 
what needs to be improved. Discussing the results of the debate with the students using 
these rubrics also helps students see for themselves which areas they can improve on. It also 
establishes a sense of fairness and gives equal weightage to different aspects that form a 
good debate.

Summative Assessment
Summative assessment will be done periodically, again on the basis of rubrics. Illustratively, stu-
dents will be given a small case study or video and asked to make explicit the process of ethical 
and moral reasoning. Assessment of the project related to engagement with local issues will be 
done both throughout and at the end of the project. 
Assessment of engagement with current affairs must never be on the basis only of knowledge. 
Again, the process must be assessed using a rubric aligned to that for summative assessment. 
After six months of the academic year, for summative assessment, students can be asked to pick 
up one of the topics of current affairs and do individual research on it; they will write an essay 
and list sources/references. Teacher may provide probing questions to ensure students are 
aware of expectations from them.
7.2.8 Teachers
There will be a need for Teachers who are aware of issues/events in the four domains that must 
be covered. Teachers of Social Science will be best placed for teaching Individuals in Society. 
a. While ethical and moral reasoning requires a sequence, it demands a sound ethical and 
moral framework, and an interdisciplinary understanding. Teachers must undergo training 
modules before they can take up this subject. These modules will focus not only on the 
content but will also require Teachers to examine their personal moral and ethical 
framework. 
b. Training modules will be insufficient for Teachers to meet the demands of students. Hence, 
Teachers within the school must meet regularly to discuss current affairs, and strengthen 
their own capacity for discussion and debate, and the application of ethical and moral 
reasoning, and applying interdisciplinary understanding. This will also help ensure 
inclusion of different perspectives, and subject-related expertise.

Physical Education
The aim of physical education in school is to help students learn to lead a physically active, vig-
orous, and healthy life. Physical education consists of movements, drills, exercises, yoga, 
games, sports, and other activities that promote mind-body wellness.  Physical education should 
provide a wide range of age- and level-appropriate physical activities that develop knowledge of 
the body, and of games and sports, together with an attitude of perseverance, teamwork, and 
sportspersonship. 
The Draft National Education Policy (DNEP) 2019 states the role of physical education thus:
“Physical education is important for both physical and mental health and development. It helps 
improve a child’s muscular and cardiovascular strength, flexibility, endurance, motor skills, 
and mind-body connection and wellness. It gives students the opportunity to set and strive for 
personal and achievable goals. Moreover, playing sports also helps students develop the qualities 
of teamwork, cooperation, problem-solving, discipline, perseverance, and responsibility. In 
general, physical activity is well established to be among the best releases for tension and anxi-
ety and facilitates emotional stability and resilience. All these qualities and benefits are also rele-
vant to success in the classroom; studies show that students who stay physically active are more 
successful with other schoolwork as well. Finally, people who are physically active as young 
people tend to stay more fit as adults as well, leading them to lead longer, healthier, and more 
productive lives.”

Aims
Physical activity is integral to human life and therefore integral to the school curriculum. For the 
individual student, sports and physical activities teach important motor skills, practices of phys-
ical fitness, socio-emotional awareness, and regulation, associated cognitive abilities, as well as 
the values of hard work, teamwork, and a gracious acceptance of one’s strengths and vulnerabil-
ities.  
Various forms of physical engagement and physical activities have been an inseparable part of 
many cultures. They have unified people across the globe over shared common interests and 
spirit. People who are not active participants themselves unite to watch and support individuals 
and teams play with each other, irrespective of class, gender, geography, and background. Indi-
vidual physical practices/activities from different parts of the globe are shared and practised 
around the world for leading a healthy and balanced life. Sports that were once practised in small 
local areas have spread around the world, bringing people together in playing them. The practic-
es of yoga have now spread around the world. Sports, games, yoga, and other such rigorous 
physical activities have allowed humanity to enjoy shared experiences, emotions, and excite-
ment. 
Just within our subcontinent, there is a very rich heritage of games and physical activities that 
developed across civilizations and centuries. For example, yoga, water sports, wrestling, 
malkhamb, archery, chariot racing, bullock racing, polo, different forms of martial arts, dance 
forms, dice games, hide and seek, and innumerable other forms physical activity, games, and 
sports have been practised across the nation over centuries. 
A good physical education program is therefore considered important for everyone, regardless 
of the field of interest one wants to pursue in life. It prepares students to live a happy, fulfilling, 
and healthy life, as helps to build values, skills, dispositions, and cultural awareness and literacy.
The aim of Physical Education in the school curriculum is to help the student:
a. Develop a love for physical activity/sports, and value it for health, enjoyment, expression, 
self-reflection, and social interaction.
b. Develop knowledge and capacity to execute different kinds of skills and movements of the 
human body, and to participate in and enjoy a variety of activities, games, and sports. 
c. Develop resilience, tenacity, and an interest in the pursuit for excellence.   
d. Nurture empathy, cooperation, fair play, and fraternity, which are relevant throughout one’s 
life to be a good human being and a contributing member of society, and learn to meet both 
winning and losing with grace.

Box B-8.1-i
Yoga
The origin of all forms of yoga practised today is in the Yoga Sutras, a collection of apho-
risms written over 2,000 years ago by the sage Patanjali. The tradition has been passed on 
through generations and is in the form we see today. 
Yoga is not just a physical practice of Asanas (postures) but is much more than that. Patan-
jali enumerates 8 limbs of yoga (Ashtanga yoga). They are Yama (universal moral com-
mandments), Niyama (self-purification by discipline), Asana (Posture), Pranayama (rhyth-
mic control of breath), Pratyahara (withdrawal and emancipation of the mind from the 
domination of the senses and external objects), Dharana (concentration), Dhyana (medita-
tion), and Samadhi (a state of super consciousness brought about by profound meditation).
Yama, Niyama, and Asana are the 3 stages of outward quests (bahiranga sadhana). Yama 
and Niyamas aim to control the student’s passions and emotions to stay in harmony with 
fellow human beings. Through the practice of Asanas, the student keeps the body and mind 
healthy, strong, and in harmony with nature. 
These are largely the same aims as that of physical education in our school curriculum. We 
want students to be healthy, strong individuals who are in harmony with their surroundings 
and are contributing members of the community. Thus, the teaching of yoga is an integral 
part of the physical education program. Yoga Asanas and practices like pranayama appear 
at multiple points in this document.

Section 8.2 
Guidelines for the Curriculum 
A few crucial principles in the designing of the PE curriculum in schools are as follows:
a. All students must play. They must engage in physical activities to whatever extent they are 
able to all through their lives.
b. Students must explore varied kinds of sports, games, and physical activities. 
c. There must be rigour and regimen in teaching PE at schools based on students’ age and 
capacities.
a. Physical Education is equally important in the overall education of a student. 
The following considerations detail how these core ideas can be implemented in schools.
8.2.1 Students Receive Equal Opportunity in PE
a. Students of all levels of interest, inclination, and ability must engage with PE. Like all 
other curricular areas, some students may be more inclined towards physical education and 
playing sports than others. This curriculum therefore suggests two modes for imparting 
physical education:  
i. 
The Compulsory Physical Education Class: All students must attend the common 
regular physical education classes on the timetable. Activities in this class can be 
different for various groups based on capacity and level appropriateness. All students 
in schools will be part of this class and receive equal attention and support for learning, 
which means equal access to physical education teacher time, equipment, and 
opportunities to play.
ii. The Optional PE after-school programme: Those students who wish to engage with 
physical activity and sports on a deeper level can be part of this programme. Schools 
may organize special skill-building classes, provide physical education teacher support, 
and access to equipment before or/and after school hours. Such an arrangement must 
be considered as part of the curriculum and not as preferential treatment as this 
opportunity should be available for all students who show interest.
b. Students of all genders should regularly play together across all age groups, keeping in 
mind safety considerations. Schools can make choices about having mixed teams in contact 
sports like kabaddi based on the socio-cultural climate and acceptance levels of such 
grouping in their locality/region. Students become accustomed to playing together and 
grow in their maturity to play comfortably in mixed-gender groups over time. So, this 
approach is best introduced as early as possible right from the Foundational stage.
c. Schools must ensure the participation of students with disabilities in physical 
education to the extent that is possible for them. This requires adapting play conditions 
and thoughtful accommodation or modification to enable them to participate. For example, 
accommodation can be done through adapting time for learning or task completion like 
392
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
increasing time to finish a run, and/or adapting the skill level or rules like a one-hand 
dribble in one place. Similarly, modifications can be made by creating rules like playing 
cooperatively with differently-skilled students and/or planning a different game/sport 
altogether like students pushing a wheelchair instead of running.
8.2.2 Students Learn Cooperation and Teamwork   
Cooperation in sports means working together as a team on playing well and on areas of im-
provement using each other’s strengths related to the game/sport. This cooperation is facilitated 
through dialogue (especially while strategizing before a game or reviewing after a game) based 
on questions such as – ‘How did I behave when my competitor got injured?’, ‘How do we con-
struct teams when we know different team members have got different abilities and each one is 
better than the others in one or two aspects?’, ‘Why are some abilities seen as more important?’, 
‘How does one feel when they lose?’, ‘How must we react in such situations?’, ‘What were the few 
crucial moments of the game when the team was competing and lost the advantage?’ etc.
8.2.3 Schools Must have PE for all Stages 
Students in the Preparatory Stage enjoy free play and want to participate in most games. We 
should encourage free play, creative manipulation of rules, and local games at this stage. In the 
Middle Stage, students should continue to play local games but should get oriented towards 
more widely-practiced games. They should also actively participate in competitive sports events 
of other schools. Students at the Secondary Stage should be encouraged to choose one sport/
game/activity and develop proficiency to compete at a high level. All students across the Stages 
must have a compulsory PE class as part of their timetable. In instances where certain students 
at a very young age become interested in participating in different interschool, local, State, na-
tional, and international competitions, schools must make reasonable accommodations so that 
they can pursue their interests.  The optional PE after-school programme should be used for this. 
8.2.4 Resources Must be Made Available for PE 
In case schools have no playground, they must ensure access to nearby public grounds/spaces 
for students. In instances where this is not possible, schools must develop ways to conduct phys-
ical activities that do not require much space such as yoga, static exercises/movements, table 
tennis, etc. 
Similarly, until a physical education teacher is appointed, other teachers must be educated to 
conduct physical activity under the guidance of any PE teacher available in the school complex/
school cluster/nearby schools. 
In case of limited equipment availability, the choice of games/sports/physical activity must be 
made accordingly. Non-availability of a playground, physical education teachers, or use-worthy 
equipment cannot be sustained limiting factors in the education and engagement of students in 
physical activities.  
393
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
8.2.5 PE must be given Equal Importance and Status
Health and Physical Education in schools have received lower importance, even a partial treat-
ment, as compared to other curricular subjects. NEP 2020 recognizes this and emphasises that it 
be given equal importance and treatment in the curriculum. Physical Education is equally im-
portant for all students, and we must create enabling conditions for it in our curriculum, infra-
structure, and school operations including appropriate time in the school calendar and teacher 
preparation.
8.2.6 Competition can be a Means to Excellence
Physical Education curriculum aims to nurture empathy, cooperation, fair play, and fraternity. A 
bad approach to competing makes competitions unhealthy and harmful. Competition in the con-
text of PE needs to be viewed impartially and as a means to enable the growth and holistic devel-
opment of students. Students must be taught to compete without compromising the values of 
sportspersonship and positive regard for others.  They must be encouraged to pursue excellence 
and perfection in practice and performance for their own sake rather than defeat and overpower 
peers. The key is to challenge oneself to grow into the next level of competence. There are sever-
al implications for this position.
a. Students must be grouped very carefully, such that it does not develop feelings of inferiority 
or superiority as both have serious negative consequences.   
b. Values such as empathy, cooperation, fair play, and fraternity must be promoted and 
celebrated each time there is a competitive event, 
c. Use winning or losing a game as an opportunity for critical reflection of feelings of undue 
pride or embarrassment/distress, the effectiveness of the strategy, etc.
d. Selection of students for interschool competitions must be fair and transparent. 
394
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Section 8.3 
Nature of Knowledge
a. To do is to know: Physical activity squarely falls under the category of practical knowledge 
where “to know” is acquired only by doing the activity. One cannot claim to know swimming 
without doing it. Once an individual has performed the activity, they can reflect, observe, and 
explain how the activity is done. But it is not useful to reverse the sequence of this progres-
sion. 
b. Requires regular progressive practice and layered learning: Physical activities are learnt 
over a period. To do an activity well, one must perform it multiple times before gaining basic 
proficiency in it. For example, to do Tadasana properly, toes should be spread out evenly, 
weight should be balanced equally between the right feet, left feet, forefoot and heel, the 
tailbone should be tucked in, and the shoulders should be pushed back. It might take weeks 
of training to get these aspects right before moving on to others. It will involve a large 
element of muscle memory - where the body aligns itself without a neural command from 
the brain - so that after a few weeks, these aspects are almost automatic. The instructor can 
then move on to other aspects of Tadasana.
c. Requires awareness and capacity to manipulate space and equipment: Awareness and 
manipulation of space are an integral part of many physical activities. This awareness is built 
by bringing about peripheral vision, occasional glances, and a lot of practice together. Along 
with awareness, a player needs to build anticipation skills and play a scenario in their head 
to strategize the next few moves. Practitioners learn to be positionally aware within the 
boundaries of the space of that sport. In judo, getting your opponent out of bounds is a way 
of scoring points. In cricket the bowler bowls to the field, and the batsmen find gaps in the 
field to hit their shots. In team sports like football and hockey, the players train in spatial 
patterns so that they know where their teammates are without looking. 
d. Learning is remembered for a very long time: Another aspect of physical activity is that 
once learnt the knowledge stays with an individual for a long time and is like second nature. 
It is difficult to forget completely how to swim or hit a topspin shot with a table tennis racket 
once you have mastered it. One might be out of touch with these activities for years but can 
restart with some practice. In some sense, the knowledge of physical practice is embodied 
and stays with us. 
e. Learning about oneself and learning how to grow: This aspect of the nature of physical 
activity can be categorised into three components.
i. 
Knowledge of physical self and capacities: A person who is regularly engaged in 
physical activities will have a better understanding of the body’s capability and 
limitations. For example, someone who lifts weights regularly will know how much 
weight they can lift in a real-world scenario (a sack of rice) against someone who does 
not. People who engage with physical activities regularly are likely to be more sensitive 
to changes in their body in the short term (need for rest or sleep, knowing when they 
are overeating, etc.) and in the long term (improving their appetite, changing sleep 
cycle etc.). 
395
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
ii. Knowledge of mental and emotional capacities: Through regular participation (and 
reflection) in sports a person also learns about how they feel and react under different 
circumstances. For example, one learns about how assertive they are, how they perform 
under pressure, how strongly they feel about an unfair situation and how they react to 
it and so on. 
iii. Knowledge of social surroundings and how to work with them: Team sports 
requires all the individuals in the team to understand each other, communicate at 
different levels (before, during and after play), build common strategies and play 
different roles required within the team teaching social and working together skills. 
396
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Section 8.4   
Practical Challenges at the Current Time
a. Status of Physical Education in Schools and Community: Physical education in schools is 
mostly considered as a subject to engage students during leisure time, recess, or when a 
subject teacher takes leave. Playing too much (sports, games, or other physical activities) is 
feared to badly impact students’ `education’. Unlike other subjects, schools lack an 
understanding of teaching and learning the subject. Whatever body of knowledge exists so 
far is more about the rules of games, playground dimensions, physiology of the body and 
nutritional requirements only.
b. Lack of Infrastructure and Resources: Physical education teaching requires open spaces, 
indoor facilities, specific exercises, and enough sports equipment’s to provide a better 
quality of learning. The lack of adequate infrastructure and resources is a huge challenge in 
most schools. 
c. Lack of availability of Physical Education Teachers in Schools: In a vast education 
system like India, the availability of teachers has always been a challenge. Particularly in 
subjects such as arts, physical education, and vocational education. The situation in subjects 
like physical education seems even more demanding. Currently, we have very few good 
education institutions providing education programmes and training for teachers and 
teacher educators.
d. Inadequate Scholarly Interest in Physical Education: “What do we know?’, and “How do 
we know?’ are perennial questions in the field of Physical Education. The lack of sufficient 
regional studies, research, and academic literature in Physical Education is not helpful for 
young scholars and researchers to pursue this area further. In India, we have depended 
heavily on foreign research and academic work. This gives us a glimpse into various 
discourses on the subject but fails to relate it to the context of the schools in the 
subcontinent.
e. Absence of school-wide Physical Education Curriculum: In the absence of a well-defined 
curriculum till Grade 10 with specific learning outcomes and even lesser clarity on 
assessment possibilities, Physical Education has faced a serious pedagogical challenge. In 
schools, students are taken outside the classroom, to perform activities, or to engage in 
playtime without structured and progressive guidance or learning standards.                   
f. Inadequate Nutrition for Physical Activities & Sports: For many students across India, 
the Mid-day Meal is the only decent meal available for the day. This means their nutritional 
needs are grossly unfulfilled and this often compromises their ability to participate in many 
planned and rigorous physical activities.
397
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Section 8.5   
Learning Standards
A ‘Nested’ Design of Learning Standards: Giving due consideration to the time schools might 
require in the implementation of Physical Education as a full-fledged subject across the Stages 
(for example appointment of teachers, acquisition of resources), this document contains ‘Nested 
Learning Standards’ for Physical Education, wherein Learning Standards have two subsets 
which have been detailed. The first subset called Learning Standards 1 is nested within Learning 
Standards 2. Thus, ‘Learning Standards 1’ should be accomplished by all schools from the 
very initiation of the implementation of this NCF and Learning Standards 2 should be ac-
complished as soon as schools add the required resources for Physical Education. 
8.5.1 Preparatory Stage
By the end of the Foundational stage, most students would be able to demonstrate basic move-
ments, motor skills, awareness of rules, and participation in activities/games. By this Stage, the 
hand-eye coordination of a student is improving, and children are learning to maintain balance 
while doing different activities. The emphasis in the Preparatory stage would be on refining 
skills and combining them into movement forms.
Therefore, opportunities should be provided to develop manipulation skills such as rolling, 
throwing, catching, dribbling, kicking, and striking.  The focus should remain on basic skills, the 
joy of playing, and the ability to display appropriate behaviours and attitudes during activity. 
Students should recognize the value of rules, fair play, safety, and respect for others.  It is strong-
ly recommended that at this stage local games must be preferred and encouraged.

8.5.2 The Middle Stage
In this Stage, students are in their adolescence, and differences in physical appearance, weight, 
height, and gender-related experiences become pronounced. Preoccupation with appearance 
and self provides teachers with opportunities to talk about health and the need for physical ac-
tivity. Participation in physical activity is important for the social, psychological, and emotional 
development of adolescents. Physical Education classes provide an ideal setting for adolescents 
to learn and practice skills of social and personal responsibility while following rules, regula-
tions, and safety procedures. It provides ground for students to perform, gain and give respect, 
and build self-confidence. Cooperation is an important social skill for this age group, including 
cooperation with opponents in a game setting and accepting responsibility for one’s behaviour. 
401
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
For this age group winning becomes important, so teachers would need to emphasize that par-
ticipation and playing well with the group as the most important. Students also learn to refine, 
combine, and apply a variety of movement and motor skills in different physical activity settings. 
Games that promote boys and girls playing together should be encouraged. It is recommended 
that children continue to play local games at this stage and at the same time get introduced to 
popular competitive games/sports.

8.5.3 The Secondary Stage (Grades 9 &10)
The developmental range of students at this Stage is diverse. Students experience numerous 
physical and physiological changes during these years. Boys typically experience a period of rap-
id growth around grade nine or until about fourteen or fifteen years of age. On the other hand, by 
grade nine, girls experience a slower rate of growth. Overall, by tenth or higher grades, most 
students start experiencing a relatively slower rate of growth. This slowdown in growth rate, 
along with increases in the length and breadth of muscles, produces a higher level of motor abil-
ity and fitness. Students’ increasing knowledge and experience during this stage gives them the 
ability to select activities they would like to pursue. By this stage children should be able to iden-
tify one sport/game in which she would like to excel and build proficiency to participate at high 
level.

Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
8.6.1 Pedagogical Approach
Several research studies confirm how students learn physical education. The following key 
points of understanding are useful to know how to teach the subject.
a. Physical Education follows the same teaching-learning principles that promote a 
student’s learning in other subjects. Giving space to students’ context, respecting 
students as individuals, providing them opportunities, connecting to their life, giving them 
level-appropriate tasks, deciding content based on learning outcomes, understanding the 
learning levels of students, and periodic assessment and feedback are effective teaching-
learning practices in physical education too.
b. PE requires teachers to demonstrate so that students can observe, practice those skills/
moves and learn. This is because physical activities fall under the category of practical 
knowledge where “to know” is acquired only by doing the activity.           
c. Providing time for interactions before and after the activity improves the development 
of cognitive concepts, values, and dispositions. Such interactions must be moderated by 
teachers and students should be encouraged to voice their opinions freely. 
d. Students learn best when they have a diverse set of activities to choose from and equal 
opportunities. The practice of motor skills in diverse ways is fundamental to fitness and 
mastery of movement in physical education. This  means designing a range of activities and 
sports for all students including those with disability. 
e. Encouraging sportspersonship, avoiding personal comparisons, and focusing on skill 
acquisition will make physical education effective. Teachers should implement methods 
to define skill attainment in terms of proficiency rather than comparison to others. A 
motivating environment and focus on personal improvement rather than personal 
comparing of students provide students with a positive and satisfying learning experience. 
Box B-8.6-i
PE class in tough and extreme weather conditions
Physical education classes could be particularly very challenging in tough or extreme 
weather conditions. India has very diverse weather conditions. Extreme cold, hot and rain 
are witnessed in several regions. The following suggestions can help in such cases.
Timetabling: Areas which witness tough (not extreme) hot and cold weather conditions 
can consider working on rearranging their timetable. For example, in hot climates, the 
Preparatory and the Middle Stage students play in the morning and the Secondary stage 
students play in the afternoon. In cold weather, the reverse can be done.
Indoor PE Activities: In extreme weather when playing outside is not possible at all, Indoor 
PE classes must be organized. Physical activities like yoga, static movements, dance, theatre, 
High-intensity interval training (HIIT) and Medium-intensity intermittent training (MIIT) 
workouts can be considered. To enable more space per student, schools should make provi-
sion for access to a big hall in the school or in the vicinity which can enable these activities.

8.6.2 Guidelines for Pedagogy 
Other than modifying activities for practice and to suit differing needs and abilities, and includ-
ing a diverse range of physical activities, the following guidelines will be useful.
a. Planning and instructions: Concrete planning of the Physical Education class is the key to 
your instructions. Some aspects of planning to consider while planning the sessions follow.
i. 
Planning to avoid injuries through warm-up and cool down activities and ensuring 
safety of equipment and space
ii. Planning to be effective through teacher demonstrations and modelling
iii. Planning for the right levels of challenge for different groups of students
iv. Planning to be focused on the learning outcomes that need to be achieved 
b. Participation and inclusion: Participation of students in all activities is the responsibility 
of the teacher. Students tend to be overenthusiastic about playing, and the teacher must 
ensure that all student gets their turn to participate. Games and activities must be chosen so 
that students of all gender and abilities can participate.       
c. Motivation: Not all students will be enthusiastic about taking part in sports, particularly if 
they fear that they will not be good. Students may be kept motivated by Teachers 
themselves demonstrating excitement and enthusiasm in the Physical Education sessions. 
Teachers must encourage active involvement, support students to acquire skills, 
acknowledge and appreciate growth and improvement rather than mere outcomes, instruct 
clearly, give everyone a chance to participate, be sensitive to students’ feelings of pressure 
or anxiety, and treat every student fairly. All this would go a long way in motivating students 
to give their full participation in the classes.
d. Safety: A safe environment in Physical Education has two components: the physical and the 
psychological. The physical refers to the need to ensure students do not get injured, that 
facilities and equipment are safe, Teacher-preparedness to handle emergencies with access 
to a doctor, proper supervision of all physical activities etc. The psychological component 
refers to the need to ensure that students feel emotionally and socially safe, and receive 
respectful treatment, encouragement, support, and fair redressal of grievances during a 
Physical Education class. 
Box B-8.6-ii
Students must also be educated to identify forms of sexually demeaning and harassing 
behaviours and empowered to report them to their Teachers and the Principal.

Below are the stage-specific variations that a teacher needs to keep in mind in the practice of 
the physical education curriculum.
Table B-8.6-ii
Variation Parameters
Preparatory
Middle
Secondary
Type of Physical Activity
Teachers should encourage free 
play and organize activities using 
games and sports. Students at this 
age get bored very easily so a 
variety of activities/games/sports 
should be used to build a skill or to 
develop a specific group of 
muscles. Drills should be discour-
aged but can be gamified to 
include element of fun. E.g., 
Instead of doing a drill on develop-
ing the throw one can divide the 
students into two teams and play a 
match of throws where each team 
scores on hitting the stump.
Demonstrates ability 
to change pattern of 
behaviour during a 
game. E.g. - Regulating 
anger or disappoint-
ment, showing 
resilience while losing 
a game.
Demonstrates ability 
to bring about a 
positive attitude in 
oneself and the team 
in the face of disap-
pointment or tough 
situations on the field
Duration and Intensity
Duration and intensity must be 
kept low. It must not be more than 
1 hour during school hours as 
students tend to fatigue and 
dehydrate easily. Their rehydra-
tion discipline has not yet formed, 
and dehydration will have a 
temporary effect on their cognitive 
abilities to participate in other 
academic activities conducted on 
the same day. The choice must be 
made of many short activities of 
small durations instead of playing 
a long game.
Duration and intensity 
must be kept moder-
ate. It can go up to 90 
minutes at least on 2 
days in a week. By this 
time students would 
be more aware about 
rehydration discipline 
and can cope up with 
it.  They continue to 
prefer many short 
activities of small 
durations. Long 
duration games/
sports can be played 
twice a week. 
Duration and intensity 
can be high. It can go 
up to 1 hour during 
school hour for all the 
students and another 
1 hour for interested 
students who wants to 
pursue sports further. 
By this time, students 
would be more aware 
about rehydration 
discipline and their 
bodies can cope. 
Responsibility of partici-
pation and Inclusion 
Participation of all students in all 
activities is the responsibility of 
the teacher.
Students will partly 
start to take responsi-
bility of inclusion, but 
teachers’ responsibili-
ty does not deteriorate
Students will share the 
responsibility with 
teachers to work on 
inclusion of all 
participate.

Physical activity integration with other subjects
There are opportunities for teachers to incorporate physical activity while teaching other 
subjects. Some strategies for this are:
Incorporating material from other subject areas into daily physical activity. For example, 
creating spatial awareness (movement concepts and skills) during a language class using 
verbs, adverbs, and prepositions.
Incorporating physical activity to help reinforce numeracy skills. For example, teaching 
estimation/measurement on the sports ground in the math class. 
In science class, teaching food and nutrition, hydration, body parts and systems and con-
necting them to the experiences on the games field.

Section 8.7 
Assessment 
It is important to clearly specify the principles of assessment as this will guide schools and in-
structors across the different Stages. Some crucial principles are as follows.
a. Assessment needs to reflect student achievement beyond physical attributes. We are 
not looking at Physical Education as a space to only learn physical skills. Our curricular 
goals bring out aspects of behaviours, understanding of rules, emotional regulation, social 
skills and building a good temperament using physical activity. This needs to reflect even in 
our assessment parameters. 
b. Observation-based assessments are very valuable. A large part of the assessment load 
will be based on observation of students while they are playing games, the way they behave 
on/off the field and how they reflect on their actions. Observation must be a key skill for the 
instructor and there must be a fair amount of time allocated to observation for all 
assessments in physical education.
c. Assessment must be an objective process through clear Stage-wise rubrics. Through 
different Stages, physical growth and the development of certain skills are expected. Since a 
lot of assessments are based on the observation of the instructor, it is important to create 
clear rubrics to define what the teacher is looking for when they observe and have standard 
documentation formats to keep track of it. This ensures that observations are objective and 
not coloured by instructors’ beliefs and biases. 
d. Continuous assessments must be done and shared with students. Across different 
Stages, the curricular goals and competencies are designed such that the physical, mental, 
or emotional changes occur in the student gradually and non-linearly. There needs to be 
some form of tracking of development and growth across stage-specific parameters 
throughout the term. The end of the term can be used to collate the development of 
students across these different parameters. 
8.7.1 Types of assessments
Assessments are done based on Stag-wise learning goals and need to be broken down into sim-
pler units to aid the process of learning. Through observation of these criteria amongst students’ 
assessment is carried out to understand where individuals stand against the learning goals that 
are expected. These observations can be broadly used in two different ways:
8.7.1.1 
Formative Assessments 
Observations that are used to understand and guide the learning process, are formative in na-
ture. For example, the instructor asks students to play a game of cricket and observes that an 
understanding of the rules is lacking, a lot of difficult catches are successfully taken, and tempers 
flare too much during the game. The instructor without sharing his observations develops next 
418
Part B

lesson plan where catching drills are reduced and more time is spent on rules and reflecting on 
their own behaviour. Self or peer assessment is also a formative assessment as it aids in the stu-
dents learning process in multiple ways

8.7.1.2 
Summative Assessments 
Observations that are used to measure or evaluate the degree of success the student has demon-
strated in their learning are summative in nature. For example, the instructor at the end of the 
course puts together a report of observable skills a student has demonstrated. This information 
is used for grading purposes. The key difference here from formative assessments is therefore 
how observations are used. In formative assessment the observation data is used to further di-
rect the learning process but in summative assessment, the observation is used to grade or re-
port. The summative assessment at the end of the term can be activities or actions that test dif-
ferent skills. These activities or actions should have been performed and taught multiple times 
during the term. 
The written components of assessments can be limited to student reflection and observations, 
rules knowledge in sports, and understanding of human bodily systems. The written compo-
nents should also be part of a continuous assessment scheme. There can also be a written exam 
at the end of the term, but it should not carry a substantial weightage in the grading.

Annexure 
Physical Activity as Mentioned in the 
Content Table
a. Kickball 
For this game, you need some space, a pitch, a ball, and markers to define boundaries.
Set up – create a pitch in the centre (with or without wickets) and boundaries for hitting 4s 
and 6s.  
Game play - This is a team game where each team has 5-6 players. The game is like playing 
cricket but with a football. A toss decides which team is fielding and which team is kicking. 
The fielding team will have bowler who rolls the football on the ground and the kicker must 
kick the ball to score runs. If the kicker misses the ball 3 times, she is out and the next kicker 
from the kicking team will replace her. Kicking team gets 5-6 overs (1 over per player) to 
score runs, after which second innings follow.  
b. Wall Target 
For this game, you need some space, a wall, a ball, and some chalk to mark the wall
Set up -Prepare the game by drawing several circles on the wall. We can draw a mix of small 
and large circles. Circles can be at different heights from the ground. Write a number inside 
each circle and that is the number of points you will gain if you hit in that circle. Larger circles 
can be lower value than the smaller circles. 
Game play – Each player will get a certain number of chances to kick/throw the ball at differ-
ent circles to gain points. The students can be encouraged to add up the points as and when 
they hit the circle. 
c. Short and long 
For this game you need open space, a ball, and several objects as targets (it can be buckets, 
stones, twigs anything that is easily visible). 
Set up - To play the game, a place is assigned to kick/throw from and at different points the 
targets are kept. The targets can be different distances from the kicking/throwing place and 
based on the distance can carry different points for scoring. 
Gameplay - Each player will get a certain number of chances to kick/throw at the target of 
their choice to score points. Depending on the age and skill of the students, the targets can be 
adjusted.
422
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
d. Roll, roll, roll the ball
For this game we need open space, cricket bat and multiple balls (ideally soft tennis balls) and 
cones for boundaries
Set up – There is a central circle where a student will stand with a bat and others will stand 
some distance away from the central player (depending on age and skill, distance can be 
changed)
Gameplay – One player will stand in the middle with a bat. Bowler will roll the ball and batter 
will hit to score only in boundaries. 
e. French Cricket
For this game we need open space, cricket bat and a soft ball
Set up – Create a large circle for the bowlers to stand and the batter stands at the centre
Gameplay – Students stand in a circle around a single batter at the centre. The batter must 
use the bat to protect her legs while other students try to ‘tag’ this area with the softball. The 
batter is out if they get hit below the knees or if a fielding player catches the ball after they 
have returned it with the bat. As a student gets out, we can give each student in the circle a 
chance to be the batter.
f. Slam kick
For this game you need a football, a wall, markers for setting up a goal
Set up – Use chalk to draw a goal on the wall itself so that whenever anyone kicks towards the 
goal, ball rebounds and comes back.
Gameplay – This game is played by 2 players at a time. Each player gets 3 lives, the player 
with the ball will attempt to kick the ball into the goal and as the ball rebounds the other play-
er needs to kick the ball back into goal before the ball stops moving. This continues till one of 
the players don’t manage to kick the ball into goal
g. Bounce catches
For this game you need a marker to mark a circle on the ground/wall
Set up – Draw a circle on the ground/wall where the ball needs to be bounced
Gameplay – This game is played by 2 players at a time. The player with the ball will bounce 
the ball in the circle and the other player needs to catch it and throw it back into the circle for 
the first player to catch. To make it difficult, play it on wall. 
h. Caterpillar catches
For this game you need a softball and cones
Set up – Just draw 2 parallel lines on the ground
Gameplay – Divide the students into 2 equal teams and get them to stand in 2 parallel lines 
(Line A and Line B) so that each student has another corresponding player standing across in 
the other line. To start the game the first student in line A throws the ball to the first student 
423
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
in line B, If the other student catches, the thrower will run and stand at the end of line A. Now 
the catcher from line B becomes the thrower and will throw the ball to the second student in 
line A, if this student catches, the thrower from line B will run to the end of his line. This will 
continue till it goes through the whole line. The distance between the 2 lines can be short to 
start with and to make the game tougher you can increase the distance.
i. Running on to high catches
For this game we need softball and cones and space
Set up – Three cones placed in a triangle format (distance between the cones depending on 
skill level and age)
Gameplay – This is a catching drill for students to learn how to move/run to catch and how 
to throw to a moving target. Player 1 is standing near a cone and the rest of the students are 
in a queue near a second cone. The first player in the queue (let us call her player 2) runs to-
wards the 3rd cone and player 1 throws the ball towards cone 3. Player 2 needs to catch the 
ball near the 3rd cone and replace player 1. Player 1 can now join the end of the queue. Now 
the next player in the queue (player 3) will run towards the 3rd cone and player 2 will throw 
the ball towards the 3rd cone. This game can continue, and the group needs to get the greatest 
number of consecutive catches.

Vocational Education
“To find out what one is fitted to do, and to secure an opportunity to do it, is the key to happiness.”
--John Dewey
Vocational Education prepares students for different kinds of ‘work’. It enables the learning of 
specific knowledge, capacities, and values through independent subjects, or integrated within 
other subjects, such that the student is ready to work upon leaving school, in one vocation or 
another, and to deal with the day-to-day practicalities of life. Despite this readiness, students 
may choose to pursue higher education, or specific training, before joining the world of work.
In the Foundational and Preparatory Stages, multiple capacities will be developed through play 
and other activities, which will be subsequently useful in vocations. These capacities will be 
called prevocational capacities. 
In the Middle Stage, exposure to a wide range of work will be given to students. This will equip 
them to achieve skills in a vocation of their choice in the Secondary Stage and help them progress 
into gainful employment. 
426

Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Section 9.1 
Aims
Work is an important part of life. It prepares individuals to deal with practical things related to 
daily life, and for economic participation. Vocational Education enables students to explore 
different kinds of work, so as to identify what they would like to pursue in order to lead a find 
meaningful and fulfilling life. It also equips them to deal with home-based work. 
The Draft National Education Policy (DNEP) 2019 states that “Vocational education is extremely 
vital for our country to run efficiently and properly, and thus it is beneficial to increasingly 
incorporate elements of vocational education into the school curriculum. Indeed, some exposure to 
practical vocational-style training is always fun for young students, and for many students it may 
offer a glimpse of future professions while for others it would at the very least help teach and 
reinforce the dignity of all labour.” [DNEP 2019, Para 4.6.6]
With this background, the following aims of Vocational Education will be achieved by all 
students:
a. Developing an understanding and basic capacities for different forms of work: 
Students will develop a broad-based understanding of different forms of work, which will 
equip them to successfully manage their personal affairs. This will also equip them to 
identify, create and initiate business, work, and community opportunities.
b. Preparation for specific vocations: Students will develop capacities to be gainfully 
employed in one or more specific vocations after leaving school.
c. Respect for dignity of labour and all vocations: Students will develop respect for the 
dignity of labour through the acquisition of values related to work and the workplace
d. Developing values and dispositions related to work: Students will develop persistence 
and focus, curiosity and creativity, empathy and sensitivity, collaboration, and teamwork. 
They will be willing to do physical work and will pay keen attention to details.
428
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Section 9.2 
Approach to Vocational Education
Vocational Education will prepare students for meaningful and productive participation in the 
world of work by learning hands-on abilities and skills (i.e., ‘physically doing’), developing equal 
respect for head-hands-heart, valuing the dignity of labour, and understanding vocational choic-
es for the future. Therefore, schools must provide students a broad but experiential introduction 
to different kinds of work, and a deep exposure to and a defined set of practical competencies in 
least one area of work.
Vocational Education draws from and builds on the competencies developed in other curricular 
areas. For example, Mathematics for calculations and estimations, Social Science to understand 
the place of work in society and production chains, Science to understand how things work and 
how their functioning can be improved. Thus, it is complementary to and builds on other curric-
ular areas, and not an isolated area.
9.2.1 Some important considerations
Along with choice of vocations to be offered, the resources and materials required, pedagogical 
and assessment approaches, the following are some important considerations for the Vocational 
Education curriculum.
a. Age-appropriate: The approach to Vocational Education will be age-appropriate. It will 
start from developing general capacities for work (or prevocational capacities) and move to 
more specific capacities for particular kinds of work. To elaborate, in the Foundational 
Stage, students will experience immersion in work through ‘doing’ and ‘creating’. In the 
Preparatory Stage, this approach will continue but students will also become familiar with 
local occupations, and factors related to participation and equality. In the Middle Stage, this 
understanding will become formalised with the introduction of a separate curricular area. 
At this Stage, students will receive a broad exposure to different kinds of ‘work’. This is 
meant to provide a holistic exposure and learning experiences across vocations for all 
students. At the Secondary Stage, students will choose one or more than one vocation to 
specialise in. 
b. As localised as possible: As far as possible, vocations offered must be available in the local 
community or region, so that students can be gainfully employed. 
c. Aspirational: At the same time, students’ aspirations must also be met through helping 
students learn vocations beyond those currently available in their village/town/city and/or 
offering vocations that are available in other towns/cities. This would require a range of 
vocations to be offered.
d. Exposure to different kinds of work: Students must be deliberately exposed to all kinds of 
work (e.g., schools must ensure that students from families with ‘white-collar’ professions 
must have a deep exposure to working with their hands on land). Schools must also take 
into account the work that students do at home and ensure that they get exposure to other 
kinds of work (e.g., if a student works on land at home, the school must ensure that she 
spends most of her time on manufacturing and services).
429
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
e. Equity considerations: Existing social inequities must be deliberately broken. Students 
from particular communities must not be slotted into particular kinds of work (e.g., it must 
not be assumed that students from potter communities will be good at craft, so they do a 
certain kind of manufacturing and nothing else.). Students from particular genders must not 
be slotted (e.g., boys and girls should have equal opportunities across working on land, 
manufacturing and services).    
f. Value for working with hands: Vocational Education offers an opportunity for all students 
to learn how to ‘do’ something with their hands and learn to value it. Education is 
incomplete without this experience and understanding. So far, opting for a vocational course 
has meant that the student is either ‘poor’ or a ‘poor performer’ in school. This will change 
with this NCF – with all students participating in Vocational Education, school education 
will act as an equaliser, and not a multiplier of inequity.
9.2.2 Foundational and Preparatory Stages – Developing  
 
  
Prevocational Capacities 
In the Foundational and Preparatory Stages, vocations themselves are not themselves important. 
The focus in these Stages should be on developing prevocational capacities.
9.2.2.1 
Foundational Stage
a. In this Stage, an integrated approach has been taken where ‘work skills’ (e.g., children learn 
to complete their tasks, children learn to take care of the material they use) are learnt 
through the regular classroom process. 
b. .The focus on physical development and motor skills through movement and exercise, 
working and completing a task and play-based education enables the development of 
age-appropriate prevocational capacities in the Preparatory Stage. 
c. One of the important Curricular Goals at this Stage is also for children to develop a positive 
attitude towards productive work and service or Seva. 
9.2.2.2 
Preparatory Stage
a. An integrated approach often works best at this Stage. 
b. .Vocational Education is integrated into ‘World Around Us’ through the inclusion of 
prevocational capacities. Competencies related to students’ understanding of occupations 
around them, observing, and engaging with animals and plants, and creating simple objects 
lay the foundation for development of vocational capacities in the Middle Stage.
c. The pedagogy at this stage also lends itself to the development of prevocational skills, for 
example, maintaining flowerpots/kitchen gardens, clay modelling, and dialogue with 
shopkeepers during visits to the local markets. 
d. Work allocation’ in school will also be a part of preparing ground for Vocational Education in 
the next Stage (e.g., taking care of the plants in class, putting away books, helping with 
cleaning after the mid-day meal). All students must be allocated responsibilities equally for 
all tasks.

Vocations and Professions
There is no categorical difference between ‘vocations’ and ‘professions’. While the general 
usage of the two words in India tends to give ‘higher social status’ to ‘professions’ and 
‘professional education’, it is ‘vocation’ that has the connotation of ‘higher calling’. The NCF 
does not differentiate between vocations and professions.
9.2.3 Middle and Secondary Stages - Developing Vocational   
  
Capacities  
In the Middle and Secondary Stages, students begin a formal engagement with vocations. In the 
Middle Stage, students get a wide exposure to many different kinds of vocations in form of proj-
ects, while in the Secondary Stage, students are exposed to Multi-skill foundation courses to 
cultivate variety of skills and broaden their sense of self and vocational interests. 
Given the wide range of vocations, there is a need to organise the curriculum so that students 
receive adequate exposure while schools are able to manage within their constraints. 
The NCF will address this concern by identifying three forms of work that include a wide range 
of vocations with some commonalities within them.
9.2.3.1 
Forms of work
The nature of different vocations differs. Most vocations (e.g., agriculture, textiles, commercial 
art) have a history of practice and utilize a variety of skills, and values and dispositions to create 
a specific work product or offer a specific service (e.g., dexterous handling of materials, 
book-keeping).  Therefore, vocations can be categorised into diverse forms of work in the world, 
which differ in terms of operations, history of practices, and potential jobs.  
Three broad forms of work that are very different from each other, yet prevalent and economi-
cally productive in our country and across the world, are the Agricultural, Manufacturing and 
Services sectors. These three sectors can be represented in the school curriculum in a simplified 
form through allowing students to experience forms of work related to growing plants and rear-
ing animals, using tools and machines to create products, and working with people.  
These forms of work will ensure all students experience work in varied contexts. For example, 
students in rural areas are exposed to the vocation of agricultural practices much more than 
students in urban areas, while those in rural areas may not be adequately exposed to the services 
sector.
In the school curriculum, these forms of work will be called: Engaging with Life and Nature, En-
gaging with Machines and Materials, and Engaging with Human Beings. They will be part of the 
Vocational Education curriculum for the Middle and Secondary Stages. These forms of work are 
described below.
431
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Providing opportunities for all students to learn across all categories of ‘forms of work’ will en-
sure equality of status and opportunity for all forms of work. Specific vocations within these 
forms of work will be as contextualised as possible. This categorization can be easily aligned to 
the National Skills Qualifications Framework (NSQF).
9.2.3.1.1 
Engaging with Life and Nature
Engaging with Life and Nature involves understanding the worldwide importance of life and the 
natural environment around us, how they function together and individually, what is the lifecycle 
of a plant or an animal, what happens in the farming of plants and rearing of animals, what are 
the agricultural, climatic, and natural requirements to take care of them. Approaching Vocational 
Education through this form of work will enable students to develop interest in nature and allied 
areas, and become conscious of their environment, and the significant changes happening around 
them. Illustratively, a school could choose developing a vegetable garden or developing a chicken 
coop as part of this category in the Middle Stage, and floriculture, dairy farming, and sugarcane 
cultivation in the Secondary Stage.
9.2.3.1.2 
Engaging with Machines and Materials
Engaging with Machines and Materials involves comprehending how any machine or tool works. 
It incorporates the processes and tasks that lead to tangible outputs. Students can be involved in 
this form of work by introducing handicraft work using various materials such as paper, wood, 
clay, and fabric. A student inclined to the work of tailoring uses basic tools such as scissors, cut-
ters, thread, pins, and machines, including the sewing machine, to sew cloth in a predetermined 
design. Student will be able to develop manual skills, attention to detail and persistence to be 
able to create high quality products. Illustratively, a school could choose to offer tailoring, car-
pentry and pottery in the Middle Stage, and welding along with advanced courses in carpentry 
and tailoring in the Secondary Stage.
9.2.3.1.3 
Engaging with Human Beings
Engaging with Human Beings involves interaction with people to understand their needs and 
requirements. It deals with the capacities to communicate well, and understand the processes 
and resources involved in providing a particular service. So, a person inclined to work in a nurs-
ing home should be well informed about procedures, and ways of communication with patients 
so as to deliver service. Through this form of work, students develop the essential interpersonal 
skills and compassion for other fellow beings and acquire the basic knowledge and standards of 
service to be provided. Illustratively, a school could choose helping in a nursing home or working 
in a shop as part of this category in the Middle Stage. In the Secondary Stage, courses could, illus-
tratively, be offered in housekeeping, and beauty culture.
9.2.3.2 
Middle Stage
a. In the Middle Stage, the approach is to provide relevant exposure to students to as many 
vocations as possible in form of projects.
b. In each Grade, 3 projects, one from each form of work will be implemented in schools. Thus, 
students, by the end of this Stage, will be able to work on nine projects. 
432
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
c. States/Schools will choose vocations, in form of projects, within the three ‘forms of work.’ 
The selection of projects must consider the context of school, locality, and age-
appropriateness of students. 
d. Some of the projects which are in alignment with the concepts of Science or Social 
Science will be supported by the respective subject teachers through revised teaching 
plans. 
e. Students will develop basic skills and knowledge in all the three ‘forms of work’ through 
relevant internships as well - Engaging with Life and Nature (poultry, dairy farms, pest 
control units, nursery, etc.), Engaging with Machine and Material (local mechanic 
workshops, carpentry workplaces, tailoring units, etc.), and Engaging with People 
(hotels, restaurant, hospitals, gyms, old age homes, beauty salons, etc.)
f. Towards end of the academic year, all the students will organise a kaushal mela in the 
school to demonstrate their projects to the school, community members and other 
stakeholders. This will include a presentation of the project work, key learnings, and 
reflections and use of learnt skills in home
9.2.3.3 
Secondary Stage 
g. In the Secondary Stage, Students will be provided exposure with Multi-Skill Foundation 
Courses.
h. This course will aim at improving student employability, cultivating vocational skills, 
improving attitudes towards school, encouraging community service and labour, and 
changes in gender role perceptions.
i. Pedagogy will include apprentice learning under the supervision of a resource teacher, 
and frequent school-based workshops

Section 9.3 
Subject-Specific Challenges
There are a few challenges with the implementation of Vocational Education that need to be ad-
dressed on priority:
a. Vocational Education is often considered the ‘last resort’ for students who are not able to 
pursue higher academic education. This social status hierarchy will have to be overcome.
b. Vocational Education has been facing curricular and resource-based constraints for over two 
decades. For instance, with schools in remote or rural locations, resources related to 
industrial setup are hard to access, thereby restricting the opportunity to give exposure to 
those students. This has only widened the gap between advantaged and disadvantaged 
students.
c. With the lack of proper infrastructure, it becomes a struggle to let students undergo 
practical exposure. Most of the schools that consist of relevant equipment (if any) such as 
computers and materials of home science are outdated or broken with no fund to repair or 
buy new ones.
d. There is a lack of understanding about assessments, especially given the emphasis on 
practical, hands-on learning. 
e. There are no formal linkages with the world of work. As per NEP 2020, students passing out 
from Grades 11-12 with Vocational Education often do not have well defined pathways with 
their chosen vocation in higher education. With such unclear directions, it is highly 
challenging to make connect with the job search in market.
f. There is no teacher education programme for the preparation of Teachers for Vocational 
Education.
434
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Section 9.4 
Nature of Knowledge
a. Vocational knowledge is significantly procedural and intended to accomplish specific tasks. 
This procedural knowledge enables further work-focussed activities, both in the world of 
work and in daily life. 
b. This procedural knowledge is enabled through propositional knowledge from other areas. 
Therefore, knowledge from other curricular areas, including Science, Mathematics, 
Language, and Social Science, is used, where relevant, to support the development of 
vocational knowledge.
c. Vocational knowledge also includes propositional knowledge specific to vocations and also 
to the context within which the vocation is practised. For example, rules and regulations, 
safety concerns, markets, transportation, etc.   
d. Vocational knowledge includes knowing how to work with people in teams, and in 
organisations. It develops sensitivity towards the environment, collaboration, integrity, 
waste management, and other values mentioned in the NEP 2020.
435
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Section 9.5 
Learning Standards
As already discussed in the Approach to Vocational Education, vocations offered in the curricu-
lum will be organised in three forms of work: Engaging with Life and Nature, with Machine and 
Materials, and with Human Beings in the Middle and Secondary Stages. Each form of work will 
have a Home Curricular Goal, which will include the competencies students develop to be able to 
contribute to home-based tasks. This Curricular Goal is essential for students to manage their 
personal life and resources more productively and meaningfully. It equips students with essen-
tial capacities to manage their day-to-day life better and establish them as competent and pro-
ductive members of the family and society.
Competencies are to be attained at the end of the stage. Therefore, interim markers of learning 
achievements are needed so that Teachers can observe and track learning, and respond to the 
needs of learners continually. These interim markers are Learning Outcomes. Thus, Learning 
Outcomes are granular milestones of learning and usually progress in a sequence leading to at-
tainment of a Competency. 
However, vocational education is different from other curricular areas in terms of content and 
approach. While in most other curricular areas, it is possible to mark a clear progression in 
Learning Outcomes as students move towards attaining a competency, this is not possible in 
Vocational Education. 
The progression across grades in Vocational Education is in terms of exposure to different voca-
tions, and the development of skills in these vocations. In each grade, students are exposed to 
different vocations through projects in the Middle Stage, and a Multi-skill foundational course in 
the secondary Stage. To see progression across different vocations as students move through 
grades is, therefore, difficult. Hence, the Learning Outcomes must be articulated in terms of 
learning a vocation in a single grade. This implies that the learning outcomes will be the same for 
all grades for most competencies. For example, let us assume students do a project on horticul-
ture related to Life and Nature in Grade 6, on poultry in Grade 7, and animal husbandry in Grade 
8. It will be impossible to map progression in Learning Outcomes across these Grades since stu-
dents will have to learn similar things related to basic knowledge, tools, place in the world of 
work, and so on. Therefore, Learning Outcomes will be the same across grades.
At the same time, students will be a mixed group, with varying levels of exposure and capacities. 
A majority of students will be doing some sort of work at home and may already have the skills 
others do not. Hence, articulating Learning Outcomes in terms of progression of skills will not be 
correct since some students will already have attained the Learning Outcomes of a higher grade. 
For example, some students may already be maintaining, and handling equipment related to Life 
and Nature, and Machine and Materials, while others may have capacities related to Human Be-
ings by virtue of supporting ageing grandparents or helping parents run a shop.
Learning Outcomes, in any curricular area do not come with rigid grade-specific boundaries. 
They are enabling guidelines for Teachers to plan their content, pedagogy, and assessment to-
wards achieving specific Competencies. In case of Vocational Education, the context is key to 
436
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
content, pedagogy and assessment. For example, a Grade 6 student will be as capable of handling 
an agricultural tool in a rural setup as a Grade 7 student, or even more so. On the other hand, 
students from an urban background may not have worked with their hands in fields. Therefore, 
it will be a challenge to assign specific learning outcomes for each Grade for each Competency. 
In the secondary stage the focus will be to further expose students to some core vocational areas 
through the Multi Skill Foundation Course. This covers areas like Workshop & Engineering Tech-
niques, Energy & Environment, Gardening, Nursery and Agriculture Techniques, Food Process-
ing Techniques (9th class) / Personal Health & Hygiene (10th class). This course aims at improv-
ing student employability, cultivating vocational skills, improving attitudes towards school, 
encouraging community service and labor, and changes gender role perceptions through multi-
skills courses which broadens students’ sense of self and future career interests and prospects. 
The four core areas represent all the three forms of work. The Engineering (material-joining, 
shaping and otherwise fabricating into usable articles, including housing) and Energy-Environ-
ment (application of electricity, non-conventional energy and systems, processes, and tools- 
computers, management techniques). It also covers basics of engineering and project manage-
ment. Home-Health (related to human life), and Agriculture (Plant and animal kingdom) give the 
skills related to clothing food and health of human beings. Agriculture covers the skill needed for 
production and preservation of food of both plant and animal origin, including care of plants/
crops.
In the Secondary Stage, students will need to be given advanced on-site exposure in industrial/
agricultural spaces to broadly understand the functioning of vocations in the world of work. 
Schools must develop linkages with local industries, farms, service centres, cooperatives, rele-
vant NGOs, state transport corporations, cottage industries, printing presses, call centres, soft-
ware design companies, mobile operating companies, law companies, local water/electricity 
boards, etc to enable students to spend part of their time gaining work/ practical experience at 
these facilities as apprentices while they are still in school.

Box B-9.5-i
Mastery of the Subject
Each Curricular Area comes with at least one expectation of making the learner attain 
mastery in the work. Be it becoming proficient to read with comprehension or to be skilled 
at balancing a bicycle while riding it. This expected competency certainly becomes an 
important outcome as it then helps the learner to apply learnt skills to more cognitively 
challenging tasks (e.g., by learning to balance the bicycle, the learner can then learn to 
regulate the speed of riding). This mastery is important; to quote Dewey, “It is a common-
439
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
place that the mastery of skill in the form of established habits frees the mind for a higher 
order of thinking.” 
However, attaining mastery in any work is a subjective phenomenon, as it depends on the 
expectation that we set for learners to accomplish, depending on the learning standards. 
Attaining mastery at something can also be visualized as climbing a stairway where, at 
each step, students acquire the skills to become competent to learn new skills at the next 
step (different levels of mastery). It is noteworthy to mention that the skills learnt alone can 
hardly be utilized without deepening knowledge and making appropriate judgements about 
how to use of skills in new situations. 
Thus, in the Middle Stage, mastery in the context of Vocational Education means that 
students are able to understand the different forms of work, and how each connects to the 
larger functioning of the world. Mastery is the attainment of the basic skills and knowledge 
of the vocation, and their application in day-to-day tasks or at times of need. For example, if 
students learn the skill of cooking, they wouldn’t need to be dependent on others to cook for 
them late at night when they feel hungry.
Mastery by the end of the Secondary Stage is associated with the deepening of knowledge, 
and a higher level of proficiency. By this Stage, students should be able to comprehend and 
create products or services with indicated quality parameters. Mastery is also in the form of 
engaging in collaborative and productive work of utility. Last but not the least, the efforts 
should result in not just skilled people but capable and cultivated human beings.
9.5.2 Illustrative Learning Outcomes
In this section, Illustrative Learning Outcomes (LOs) of a specific Competency (C) given under a 
Curricular Goal (CG) will be presented to gain a comprehensive picture of the progression of 
learning which will take place in students across Stages and Grades.

Section 9.6 
Content
Content for Vocational Education will be selected at two levels. At the first level, a selection will 
have to be made of vocations within the forms of work (please refer to Section 13.2.3.1). At the 
second level, a selection will have to be made related to the specific tasks and understanding 
students will have to engage with.
9.6.1 Principles of Selection of Content within Forms of  
 
  
Work
The following principles are intended to inform content selection at the level of forms of work, 
that is, related to the vocations to be offered by the school.
a. Content selected must be as locally as relevant as far as possible: Students will better 
connect to the locally contextualised work and will be able to utilise the acquired skills and 
knowledge in their daily lives. Resource persons and sites for practice will also be easily 
available. They will have greater chances of local employment. For example, is a rural setup, 
for the different forms of work, (i) agriculture and livestock rearing, forest-related jobs; (ii) 
handling and repair of farm machinery, driving heavy vehicles for transport; and (iii) 
catering to primary health needs of community members, automotive services can be 
offered. In an urban setup, for the different forms of work, (i) floriculture, nursery 
management; (ii) handicraft work, welding, and casting; and (iii) hospitality and tourism, 
automotive services can be offered.
b. Content should cater to students’ aspirations: Content must also enable exposure to 
vocations not practised locally and cater to their aspirations for potential employment in 
jobs other than available at that point in time. For example, students living in an urban setup 
are often not exposed to hands-on agricultural and livestock rearing activities, while 
students in rural contexts do not have much practical experience of Information and 
Communication Technology (ICT). The content selected should keep in mind the balancing 
act of exposure to different forms of work, while ensuring sufficient depth due to availability 
of certain workplaces close to the school. 
c. Content must be aligned to the expectations outlined in the NSQF: Alignment to the 
NSQF will allow them to pursue further engagement with the vocation of their choice later 
in life, while offering recognition for employment. To enable this, chosen content in Grades 9 
and 10 should progress into advanced offerings in Grades 11 and 12.  For example, a student 
selecting livestock rearing in Middle and Secondary Stages must be able to pursue the 
vocation of livestock management. Similarly, a student studying beauty treatment should be 
able to progress into specialisations in makeup and hairstyling. 
443
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
9.6.2 Principles of Selection of Content within Vocations
The following principles are intended to inform content selection at the levels of specific tasks 
and understanding that students will have to engage with.
a. Content must be age-appropriate: This will ensure that students acquire the required 
competencies as per their developmental stage and learning in other curricular areas. For 
example, a student of early Middle Stage cannot start working with building circuit boards 
before working with simple circuits.
b. Content should be interesting and meaningful: Content selected should allow for varied 
activities, with scope to critically observe processes, and offer challenges within the 
capability of students. For example, while students must follow the standard stepwise 
processes involved in farming, they must be able to enjoy and appreciate the process of a 
plant growing, observe significant changes that happen to a plant, and the natural and 
man-made factors affecting the growth of a plant. They must have a sense of achievement 
once the plant is ready for use.
c. Content must instil respect for dignity of labour: No particular work can be considered 
as a ‘high level’ work if each and every form of work is looked upon with equal respect and 
honour. The chosen content should also deal with the notions and beliefs associated with 
them, so as to give students a chance to explore different perspective as well. For example, 
they must realise the critical role each individual plays in any workplace – from the manager 
of a restaurant to a chef to the person who cleans the kitchen. 
d. Content must enable exposure to different aspects of vocations: Students must get a 
comprehensive exposure of different kinds of work. For example, sometimes students do 
not need any exposure since they are already working (either with family members or 
through relatives and contacts) but need specific capacities in that work to be developed. 
For example, a student might know the use of digital media, but should also develop the 
capacity of gathering relevant information to improve processes. Another example is of a 
student who is working on the family farm; this student must understand the process 
through which produce from the farm reaches the market.
e. Content must enable exposure to the ecosystem within which the vocation is placed: 
Each vocation operates within its own ecosystem. This ecosystem is local, and also extends 
beyond a small geography. It also includes intangibles like relationship with clients, informal 
and formal codes of conduct, technical language, opportunities for improvement. For 
example, a tailor operates in an ecosystem comprising local suppliers of materials, 
technicians to help with machines, helpers to sew hems, etc, and clients. The larger 
ecosystem comprises farmers producing cotton, weavers, cloth mills, transportation, 
producers of design catalogues, websites offering technical advice, professional 
associations. Students must learn about both the local and larger ecosystems. 
444
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
f. Content must encourage students to develop and pursue specific interests: Students 
should be encouraged to not just learn the skills of any work, but to develop curiosity to 
know how the work takes place in different contexts, why and how tools and machines 
work, what will happen in the absence of these tools and machines, etc. Such exposure helps 
students select from the forms of work available to them. Once the preferred interest of 
vocation is chosen by the students, the selected content should educate them on the gainful 
employment opportunities to contribute to the economy of the country as well. For 
example, student choosing to be in the automotive services should be aware about the place 
of this service in the world of work (such as in local shops, transport business, vehicle 
service centres).
g. Content must provide hands-on exposure: The essence of Vocational Education lies in the 
work being done practically. The relevant content, when it exposes students to multiple 
modes of hand-on tasks, enables them to attain mastery. For example, a student with no or 
minimal hands-on exposure to the work of carpentry will not be able to evaluate the quality 
of a finished product.

Section 9.7 
Pedagogy
Knowledge, capacities, and values related to Vocational Education are acquired through consis-
tent practice of doing and exposure to on-site work. Students must be able to experience actual 
workplaces and meet people in these workplaces. They must have opportunities to discuss their 
experiences and reflect on their own learning.
9.7.1 Principles of Pedagogy
The following pedagogic principles need to be considered across the Middle and Secondary Stag-
es:
a. Pedagogical approaches must include a mix, with focus primarily on inquiry, hands-on 
experiential learning, group work and the didactic approach (instructions and 
demonstration). 
b. Students must engage with both theory and practice.
c. Learning should take place in the context of real life as much as possible.
d. Pedagogical approaches must be inclusive.
9.7.2 Pedagogical Principles in Action
9.7.2.1 
Pedagogical Approaches
A combination of inquiry, hands-on and didactic (instructions and demonstration) approaches 
will primarily be used for Vocational Education. 
 Students should be able to inquire into work-related processes and factors affecting them. The 
Teacher could ask students to explore questions that relate to their context. For example, in the 
Middle Stage, students could be asked “Which plants in your surroundings needs the highest 
amount of sunlight and water intake (Engaging with Life and Nature)?” or “Have you observed 
how the doctors and nurses behave with patients and their attendants, and why do you think 
they behave like that (Engaging with Human Beings)?” These questions could progress to more 
complex work-related questions at the Secondary Stage. For example, students could be asked to 
compare alternative ways of performing a task such as irrigation or the reasons for differences 
in payment to the farmer and cost to a customer for farm produce.
Teachers must ensure that these inquiry-based tasks lead to a productive discussion so that stu-
dents develop interest in the selected content and develop curiosity to further explore that voca-
tion. 
Group-based activities are useful for all forms of work. For example, students exploring the forms 
of work related to Engaging with Human Beings can be given group-based activities as it helps in 
better understanding and awareness of the nature of people and quality of services. For students 
exploring the forms of work related to for Engaging with Nature and Life, and Machine and Ma-
448
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
terials, some tasks require multiple types of activities. Working together helps students learn 
how to coordinate and use each other’s strengths. Teachers must think carefully about the size 
of groups formed and the competencies they want their students to develop. Care must be taken 
that all students are included for participation, and no one based on genders or disabilities 
should be excluded. 
The demonstration of tasks plays a significant role in Vocational Education. Students can ob-
serve how tasks can be done. They can discuss alternative ways of doing the task and come up 
with an explanation of why the task was done in a specific manner. 
The crucial part for all pedagogical approaches is that the Teacher must give students time for 
trial and error, and for finding the optimum approach to tasks. 
Another important aspect is to provide opportunities for consistent practice, to enable students 
to find the way they are able to work efficiently. 
9.7.2.2 
Mix of Practice and Theory
The Teacher must plan a judicious mix of theory and practice – the proportion of hands-on work 
must be higher than that for theoretical understanding. As far as possible, learning from other 
curricular areas should be referred to while developing a theoretical understanding. For exam-
ple, conceptual understanding from Environmental Education in the Secondary Stage can be 
taken to sensitise students of the environment and life forms around them, which will eventual-
ly help the students in field of practice engaging with livestock and agriculture. 
In the Middle Stage, focus will be on not just the knowledge of the selected vocation but also the 
broader knowledge of the domain (e.g., if students are preparing to work as a Nursing Assistant, 
then the domain will be healthcare), and its place in the world of work. 
Students must be able to apply basic skills related to the vocation, while being under consistent 
supervision. They could take up internships at carefully selected workplaces.
In the Secondary Stage, the proportion spent on practical application must be greater. Students 
must also build an in-depth understanding of the place of the vocation in the world. At this Stage, 
apprenticeships can be offered to students, under the guidance of Resource Teachers/Master 
Instructors in nearby facilities where the chosen work is practised. 
9.7.2.3 
Learning as Close to Real Life as Possible
Pedagogy of vocational education will require different sites to ensure opportunities to learn in 
real life contexts. While this is not always possible, pedagogical approaches in the classroom 
must also align to real life.
9.7.2.3.1 
In the classroom
Teachers must ensure learning experiences are as authentic as possible. Real life-based case 
studies on human interaction, behaviour and the provision of services can be used.  Videos/films 
can be used to understand work in areas different from the one the school is situated in. For ex-
ample, while students in a rural school can collaborate with the nearby PHCs, students in urban 
schools can be given exposure to the audio-visual contents showing the functioning of PHC 
healthcare workers. The reverse can be done to show rural students how big city hospitals work. 
449
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
9.7.2.3.2 
Exposure visits and follow up
Exposure visits to nearby hospitals to understand the roles and responsibilities of nurses and 
healthcare workers, or to nearby factories, cottage industries can be organised with specific ob-
jectives in mind. Students must get an opportunity to engage with persons in these workplaces, 
and Teachers could organise follow-up visits as well as visits from Resource Persons to reinforce 
learning. 
9.7.2.3.3 
Workshop setups in schools
The forms of work in the curriculum all require space with a workshop-based setup. For exam-
ple, for a basic tailoring session, a workshop can be set up in the schools in collaboration with the 
community tailors; ICT training can be given by a qualified computer graduate in the school 
premise provided basic computers and Internet connectivity are available.   
In the Middle Stage, such a set-up can be created within the school premises for selected work 
forms, even if it is not as comprehensive as in an actual place of work. For example, a food pro-
cessing unit, a computer laboratory, a fabric unit, a machinery unit could be setup depending on 
the local context, and support from relevant stakeholders, including members of the community 
who will act as Resource Persons.

Woodcarving
Objective: Carving a square on a piece of wood
Skills: Holding a chisel (feather-hold and full-fist hold), using a chisel at different angles to 
the wood, and using a mallet  
Materials: Piece of carving-worthy wood (here – recycled construction material, Burma 
teak), sharp flat chisel, wooden mallet 
Description of activity:
It was a regular morning with the sun beaming into the woodwork shed. 11-year-old voices 
and footsteps drew closer and scrambled quickly into the large workspace through the 
shed’s short corridor. 
Bright expectant pairs of eyes shone from ten heads, six girls and four boys. Some began 
scanning all the tools and waste wood material in the room. Finally, they laid their eyes on 
the small square pieces of recycled teak wood, chisels, and mallets placed before them. These 
were arranged at a two-plus feet distance around the large central table and on two other 
smaller tables in the corners of the shed.
“Hi. Welcome to your first woodwork class!” I beamed with enthusiasm. “Are you all excited 
and looking forward?” 
Some nodded a yes vigorously and others replied with a resounding “Yaa!”
“Let us get to working immediately then. First, let us think of five rules of safety before we 
start with woodcarving”.  
450
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
“We cannot touch any tools” was the fastest reply.
“… and can’t run around in the shed”
“We can’t play with materials and must treat them properly”
“We can’t hit each other with the hammer!” (The whole group broke out into giggles)
“Yes, please! Do not hit each other with anything for that matter!” I grinned back. “What 
else?” 
“We can’t work here without you being around?” was the last. Some general silence fol-
lowed.
“Good. So let us agree to the following five basic rules:
No running around in the shed
No playing with the tools, but you are allowed to observe and touch them
For now, you can come to work in the shed only when I am around
You will all learn to set up and put away materials for every class
You will keep your footwear on and be alert when you are moving around in the shed
And most importantly, observe closely, listen carefully, and follow instructions obediently!”
Muffled giggles, “That is six rules!” 
“Yes, and we will have many more along the way…” I smirked. 
“First let us start with the most basic tools we will use for the next few classes in woodcarv-
ing. This is a handle-less flat chisel, this is a semi-curved chisel, and this is a wooden mallet. 
This is a clamp to hold the wood down to the table, and this is a piece of wood you will start 
working with.”
“What wood is this? It smells dusty” a curious face checked in. 
“This is Burmese teak that was once used as part of a village house around here. We are 
recycling. I got the salvaged wood cut to small squares at the local sawmill.” 
I continued, “We are first going to practise the action of holding a chisel and a mallet. Please 
pick up the flat chisel with your non-dominant hand and the mallet with your dominant 
hand.”
“Now, there are two ways you will try holding the flat chisel. Let us call the first hold the 
full-fist hold like this… (demonstrated) and let us call the second hold the feather hold, like 
this… (demonstrated)” I gave them five minutes to experiment with the holds. They were 
quite engrossed.  
“Try using the wooden mallet and strike gently on the head of the chisel, like this… (demon-
strated). You will learn how much force you will apply while striking along the way.”
“Yeah…otherwise the wood will break!” one of the girls surmised.
“You are right…” I acknowledged. Also remember, you must explore the angles at which you 
will hold the chisel against the wood. A ninety-degree angle will push the chisel deep, like 
this…(demonstrated), and a less-than-ninety-degree angle of the chisel to the wood will 
drive the chisel diagonally, like this…(demonstrated), and a very low degree, say ten-degree 
angle, will do something different which you shall find out…”
451
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
They all looked in silence, rather attentively. 
“For today we will explore how to carve out a small square in the wood in front of you. You 
will have to use many angles of the chisel to the wood and different amounts of force in your 
mallet striking.”    
“When you feel that your chisel is stuck or is digging into the wood in a way you did not 
intend, stop and call out to me. I will show you what the ‘grain’ of wood means and what 
happens when you go against the grain.”
“Please approach your pieces of wood and show me how you will start working with the 
chisel and the mallet without actually doing it first.” They all follow instructions and mime 
the action of holding the chisel at ninety degrees off-centre on the square piece of wood, 
with a fist-hold and mallet striking a couple of times.
“You may start now, but slowly. Don’t be in a hurry, please…” I declare.
“But what about the semi-curved chisel?!” asked an exasperated boy. 
9.7.2.3.4 
Internships
In the Middle Stage, students can actually participate in real workplaces. For example, students 
can spend a few days as interns in institutions near the school, such as hospital, restaurant, po-
lice station, post office, industries, local gym, beauty salon, local poultry or dairy farm, local nurs-
ery, parks, and shops. They could spend a few hours in small groups over a period of a few days. 
Teachers must be closely involved and ensure detailed discussion on all aspects of student expe-
riences. 
Box B-9.7-i
Internship
Internship is a short duration placement in a workplace to learn about a specific job role. 
NEP 2020 emphasises the importance of internship, ‘All students will participate in a 10-day 
bagless period during Grades 6-8 where they intern with local vocational experts, such as 
carpenters, gardeners, potters, artists, etc. Similar internship opportunities to learn voca-
tional subjects may be made available to students throughout Grades 6- 12, including 
holiday periods’. (Para 4.26)
Internship enables students to experience a workplace environment that cannot be simulat-
ed in a classroom. They can observe and put forward questions to adults who are working at 
different jobs. This ‘real’ experience provides students to explore and decide whether they 
would like to take up the related vocation for further study. It also helps them identify the 
values and dispositions relevant in the workplace. 
Students must have opportunities to engage with work that is aligned to their current 
capacities. A comprehensive orientation of both students, and the individuals at the work-
place will be required, with regular follow up discussions. Members of the workplace will 
have to be sensitised to ensure safety of students – physical and emotional.  
452
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Specific examples of workplaces where this internship can take place are:
• Engaging with Life and Nature – poultry, dairy farms, pest control units, nursery.
• Engaging with Machines and Materials – local mechanic workshops, carpentry 
workplaces, tailoring units.
• Engaging with Human Being – hotels, restaurant, hospitals, gyms, old age homes, beauty 
salons.
Assessment could be in the form of a reflective note, and/or presentation at the end of the 
internship. Students could also do a short project during the duration of the internship. 
9.7.2.3.5 
Apprenticeships
In the Secondary Stage, students will need to be given advanced on-site exposure in industrial/
agricultural spaces to broadly understand the functioning of vocations in the world of work. 
Schools must develop linkages with local industries, farms, service centres, cooperatives, rele-
vant NGOs, state transport corporations, cottage industries, printing presses, call centres, soft-
ware design companies, mobile operating companies, law companies, local water/electricity 
boards, etc to enable students to spend part of their time gaining work/ practical experience at 
these facilities as apprentices while they are still in school. 
Box B-9.7-ii
Apprenticeship
Apprenticeship involves on-site work experience over a long-term period to gain experien-
tial skills and knowledge under the supervision of a mentor. Apprenticeship in the Second-
ary Stage will enable students to gain capacities to enter the workplace after completion of 
schooling, or help them decide whether they would like to pursue a specific vocation.
Apprenticeship enables hands-on practice at on-site locations. Students develop an under-
standing of the culture, values and dispositions, and vocabulary of the workplace, and 
factors that affect functioning. They can develop a portfolio of their work to demonstrate 
their readiness for gainful employment.
Mentors will be experienced workers, with the ability to engage with students. They will 
need to undergo a short course offered at the DIET/BITE that will prepare them to be 
effective mentors. 
A detailed design for the apprenticeship will have to be put in place. Modes could include 
apprenticeship of about a month and a half during the summer vacation. Alternatively, 
students could spend 2 hours after school hours a few days a week. 
Assessment could be through demonstration of work by students, or a portfolio maintained 
during the apprenticeship. This should also include observations of students by the mentor.  
453
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
9.7.2.4 
Inclusive Pedagogy
One of the fundamental principles mentioned in NEP 2020 is equity and inclusion to ensure that 
all students are able to thrive in the education system. In Vocational Education, all students 
should be given equal access in terms of working with tools and resources. Care has to be taken 
with tools and materials that are to be carefully used, such as scissors, needles, etc. The level of 
working and supervision will depend on the learning needs of students. The Teacher will have to 
ensure the comfort of the students, to ensure all students participate.  
Teachers must ensure no discrimination takes place towards students having disabilities or to-
wards students from specific genders or socio-economic backgrounds, not only in the school 
premise but also at external workplaces by other students, external trainers, or associated stake-
holders. 
Schools must coordinate with Resource Centres having special educators to meet the rehabilita-
tion educational needs of learners with severe or multiple disabilities.  An understanding of how 
to teach students with specific disabilities (including learning disabilities) must be an integral 
part of all Teacher education programmes.
Rigid gender roles still exist in society. Awareness must be built among stakeholders that the 
capacity for doing any work is independent of gender. Training modules for Teachers as well as 
Resource Persons/Master Instructors will need to address this aspect. For example, a boy is ca-
pable of working as a nurse, and a girl is capable of working as a welder.

Assessment 
9.8.1 Overall approach
a. Formative assessment at this Stage will be done by the Teacher as well as a Resource 
Teacher/Master Instructor or mentor in case of apprenticeship or internship; coordination 
will be necessary between them and Teachers to ensure valid and reliable assessments as 
well as to ensure the results are used meaningfully
b. Summative assessment will need to be done periodically. For example, at the end of a short 
period spent doing a specific task or at the end of a specific interval of time. 
c. Maintenance of a portfolio of work (for examples, products, photographs of products, 
reflective notes) as well as an exhibition of student work can also be approaches for 
formative and summative assessment, respectively.  
d. Weightage of 75% could be given to performance of tasks and 25% to evaluation of 
theoretical understanding in a summative assessment.
9.8.2 Formative Assessments
a. Formative assessment at this Stage will be done by the Teacher as well as  a Resource 
Teacher/Master Instructor or mentor in case of apprenticeship or internship; coordination 
will be necessary between them and Teachers to ensure valid and reliable assessments as 
well as to ensure the results are used meaningfully.
b. Maintenance of a portfolio of work (for examples, products, photographs of products, 
reflective notes) can be used for formative assessment.  
9.8.3 Summative Assessments

Section 9.9 
Enabling Conditions 
9.9.1 Teachers, and Master Instructors/Resource Persons
While schools offering Vocational Education have successfully employed professionals, formal 
structures, and processes for preparing teachers for all grades and vocations are still to be put in 
place. 
Therefore, till such time these programmes are available, Teachers of other subjects will have to 
teach Vocational Education in the Middle Stage, with support from Resource Teachers, also re-
ferred to as Master Instructors in NEP 2020. For instance, women from the Madhubani District 
of Mithila region in Bihar can be invited to schools to help students learn about and to create 
Madhubani paintings. However, the Secondary Stage will demand specialisation in specific voca-
tions.
NEP 2020 proposes that “Special shorter local teacher education programmes will also be avail-
able at BITEs, DIETs, or at school complexes themselves for eminent local persons who can be hired 
to teach at schools or school complexes as ‘master instructors’, for the purpose of promoting local 
professions, knowledge, and skills, e.g., local art, music, agriculture, business, sports, carpentry, and 
other vocational crafts” (Para 5.25). Therefore, guidelines for preparing these Resource Persons/
Master Instructors will have to be developed by SCERTs, and appropriate modules developed by 
DIETs/BITEs.
The content of these short-term training courses must orient them not only to school pedagogy 
but the need for sensitivity and inclusion while interacting with students; they must also be 
aware of legal provisions related to school education. 
It follows that the first step would be to create a pool of ‘Master Instructors’ locally on priority. 
These ‘Master Instructors’ have a very important role to play, since they will supplement the 
expertise of the regular teachers. These Master Instructors maybe artisans (rural and urban), 
health practitioners, mechanics, technicians, farmers, folk artists, local entrepreneurs, persons 
involved in poultry farming or fishing, persons retired from the defence services, IT profession-
als, beauticians, etc They can be brought in as guest faculty, and can either impart knowledge of 
both theory and practice in their respective vocations or provide only practical training, as the 
case may be. In cases where specialised practical training is being provided to students outside 
schools, external instructors can also be brought in to teach the theoretical aspects along with 
mentors at the workplace. 
Student internships and apprenticeships must take place in the workplace these Resource Per-
sons/Master Instructors are associated with.
Schools must assist these Master Instructors to become comfortable in an academic environ-
ment, to handle students, and to comply with broader definitions of curricular and assessment 
frameworks in their work, through the short-term training courses provided at the DIETs/BITEs 
or the school/ school complex itself. 
456
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
9.9.2 Conducive Space and Resources
The support of the community can also be taken to borrow materials and tools for use in schools. 
For example, agricultural or nursery tools can be taken from the local farmers or nurseries for a 
brief period of time to grow plants in the school grounds.
 Relevant exposure of machines and equipment will also be required for students to apply the 
skills and knowledge acquired. Collaboration with the local shops and industries (e.g., art galler-
ies, carpentry and automotive shops), nearby farms and nurseries, hospitals, and tours and trav-
els businesses (e.g., healthcare, tourism and hospitality, automotive service) will help provide 
necessary exposure and learning to understand the relevance of the vocation in the world of 
work.
A skill lab can be set up in schools to provide a ‘real work’ environment for students to work at. 
These skill labs can also be accessible for nearby schools to utilise. By channelling the investment 
of governments and CSRs, conducive spaces can be formed, even at remote locations. 
9.9.3 Safety Considerations 
Safety considerations related to Vocational Education involve both the physical and emotional 
safety of students. 
Physical safety relates to the use of equipment that has the potential to harm students, as well as 
the need to move out of school to experience real life work. Emotional safety relates to protecting 
them from exposure to sights that may distress them, as well as the sensitising persons who will 
interact with them within and outside the school.
Forms of work involving the use of materials and complex tools need to be first instructed and 
demonstrated by the Teacher. The Teacher must indicate the necessary precautionary steps. Cor-
rectly holding the tools (e.g., while using shovel, needle, cutters) while performing a task can 
prevent injury, and also help create efficient products. Students should also be encouraged to 
take care of the tools and materials, and not use them for fun or to tease fellow students with. 
Teachers will have to be very observant of students’ practices with the tools and materials so as 
to guide them appropriately.
Exposure visits, internships and apprenticeships will have to be carefully planned in consulta-
tion with parents/guardians to ensure safe transit between school, home and workplace. Prefer-
ably, a Teacher should accompany students of the Middle Stage when they go for internship; if 
not possible, then a volunteer from the community can accompany the students. It is even possi-
ble for Secondary Stage students to be apprentices at the same place to assist Middle School 
students.
All Resource Persons/Master Instructors as well as other employees must be sensitised and be 
aware of legal provisions related to safety of students. Teachers must be in regular contact with 
them to discuss any challenges they may be facing related to students. DIETs/BITEs must also 
develop follow-up modules for Resource Persons/Master Instructors based on an analysis of 
their needs.
457
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
9.9.4 Conducive space for students with disabilities 
Assistive devices and appropriate technology-based tools must be made available to help stu-
dents with disabilities integrate more easily into classrooms and engage with Teachers and their 
peers, in addition to textbooks and manuals in Braille or audio-visual formats.
Collaboration with specialised agencies like the National Association for the Blind (NAB), Na-
tional Institute for Visually Handicapped (NIVH), and other institutions to design and customise 
vocational education courses across stages for school education can be ensured by NCERT. A 
similar approach can be done for placing students for employment. 
9.9.5 Textbooks and Manuals
Textbooks and manuals will have to be developed for the Middle and Secondary Stages. These 
textbooks and manuals, written in the language of instruction with comprehensible text and 
pictures, must be contextualised to locally prevalent vocations. They must detail the conceptual 
and procedural knowledge of the vocation. References to the theoretical concepts from other 
curricular areas, where and when needed, must be added.  
These textbooks and manuals must be available in Braille, along with audio-visual and online 
content for maximum accessibility and inclusion of students. Development of textbooks and 
manuals will have to be done by the SCERT, assisted by the Pandit Sunderlal Sharma Central In-
stitute of Vocational Education (PSSCIVE).
9.9.6 Time
Vocational Education in the Middle Stage should be given at least 2.5 hours per week of time 
while it can be increased to 3 hours per week in the Secondary Stage. This time should be avail-
able in blocks, especially since Resource Teachers/Master Instructors can spend specific time 
periods with students, to be followed up by Teachers of other subjects. Additional periods during 
Grades 9 and 10 can be utilised for student who want to follow a special interest.

Section 10.1 
Introduction
By the time students reach Grade 11 in schools, this NCF would have provided to all students 
breadth of learning across curricular areas. 
These curricular areas are expected to give students a well-grounded understanding of the world 
and develop their capacities to use this understanding to make well-informed choices and act 
upon them. 
This breadth of exposure to all students enables them to decide on the disciplines they would 
like to study deeper in class 11 and 12. 
The NCF requires students to study deeper  in a minimum of four disciplines spread across a 
minimum of three curricular areas to graduate from school. The choice of these disciplines would 
depend on the preliminary understanding of the discipline, students’ interests, and their career 
choices. The minimum of three curricular areas ensures that the students at the school level do 
not make very narrow choices that result in premature hyper-specialization without a fuller 
understanding of different forms of knowledge.
Each discipline is expected to offer four courses which together have adequate depth to give the 
students an introduction to the discipline in terms of the key questions and concerns addressed 
by the discipline and the methods of inquiry specific to the discipline. With these introductions, 
students can make informed decisions about their choices in higher education and working life. 
The richness of the all disciplines is such that such a ‘4 course deep introduction’ can be designed 
in many ways, each equally valid and appropriate. This chapter gives designs of the four courses 
in a few disciplines in each curricular area. 
This chapter does not cover all disciplines. Curriculum developers would need to choose the 
disciplines that would be offered in the relevant schools, which would have to take in to account 
practical considerations such as availability of teachers.  
Then the (minimum) of 4 courses would have be developed on the basis of:
a. Giving adequate breadth of key conceptual structures that are fundamental to the discipline. 
These have to be chosen based on the contemporary paradigms of the discipline. For e.g., 
rather than looking at biology as not merely a descriptive and observational study of botany, 
zoology, and physiology, shifting to a more analytical study of molecules, organisms, and 
ecologies would be more appropriate. 
b. Giving appropriate depth into the methods of inquiry that are specific to the discipline. 
c. And, in the case of interdisciplinary areas, vocational education, arts, and physical, a set of 
four courses which would introduce a particular domain within these areas with adequate 
breadth and depth.

Section 10.2 
Humanities
In the Humanities curricular area, programmes for Philosophy, and English Literature have been 
illustrated. 
10.2.1 Philosophy
10.2.1.1 Principles for Course Design
Philosophy is commonly thought of as a discipline that requires students to memorise the 
thoughts and ideas of people who lived in centuries past. However, such an approach fails to de-
liver crucial learning outcomes such as critical thinking and problem-solving. The focus, of this 
programme of study, is the acquisition of tools and skills that can then be used in a variety of 
contexts, both academic and extra-academic. The set of four courses together aims to create in-
dependent thinkers who have a clear understanding of and grounding in the local context and 
are able to, at the same time, apply abstract ideas to a range of concrete contexts, locally and 
globally. The philosophical toolbox offers tools that allow for lifelong learning. 
Each of the courses below takes a comparative approach, rooted in Indian thought and the Indian 
context but also encouraging dialogue between different traditions and time periods. These 
courses will allow students to see how ancient ideas can shed light on current problems. They 
will also be able to see how solutions from one context can address problems from another con-
text. Such an approach requires not only thinking critically but thinking creatively, imaginatively 
and innovatively.
The pedagogy for each of these courses will be inquiry-driven and learner-oriented and will re-
quire students to constantly apply the ideas they are being introduced to. These courses are also 
best taught through a dialogical approach which will help students learn to cooperate with one 
another as well as to have a more active and critical approach to the material that is being intro-
duced to them. 
The focus on Indian philosophy is important for students to understand and appreciate the rich 
traditions of Indian philosophical thought, something which Western world has only recently 
started to become cognizant of. The ideas found in these ancient texts, many of which have still 
not even been translated, are also still under debate in contemporary philosophy the world over. 
We will study classical Indian philosophy not only for its own sake but also because it can often 
shed new light on contemporary issues. Our focus will also not be limited to classical Indian phi-
losophy but will include important modern Indian thinkers from the 20th century, many of 
whom themselves attempt to synthesize ancient Indian and later Western ideas. 
Such a programme of study should prepare them well for higher education as well as, eventually, 
for a range of careers. The focus is, furthermore, not only on cognitive capacities but also on the 
development of an ethos that will allow our students to become better citizens. Courses like eth-
ics and environmental philosophy are crucial for the development of this sensibility. 
463
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
There will be three compulsory courses followed by a choice between three electives for the 
fourth one. The choice of the fourth course will depend on the students’ interest as well as other 
courses they may be taking in other disciplinary areas.
10.2.1.2 Illustrative Courses
Course 1: Reasoning
This course will introduce students to the philosophical toolbox that they can then use in a range 
of other subjects as well as in their everyday lives. The focus will be on different kinds of reason-
ing, both formal and informal. We will draw on the rich tradition of Indian logic using ideas from 
texts such as the Vaiśeṣika-sūtra, Vārṣagaṇya’s  Ṣaṣṭi-tantra, and Akṣapāda’s Nyāya-sūtra. 
Students will learn to identify, reconstruct and evaluate arguments. They will learn different 
techniques for responding to arguments and, in so doing, will also learn how to participate coop-
eratively and constructively in debates. These are not the kinds of competitive debates that stu-
dents are usually exposed to in schools but are, rather, based on the classical Indian model of 
vaada: rigorous debate but with a focus on cooperation rather than competition. 
Students will be introduced to formal (deductive) reasoning through propositional calculus. This 
will help them learn, e.g., what is wrong with this argument: Students will pass the course only if 
they study hard; Anand studied hard; therefore, he’ll pass the course. They will also be intro-
duced to probabilistic reasoning and learn how the probability of the premises of an argument 
being true constrains the probability of the conclusion being true. 
Finally, they will study inductive reasoning with a focus on arguments from analogy and infer-
ence to the best explanation. Inferential arguments are used not only in the modern sciences but 
are also found in works such as the Yogācāra-bhūmi-śāstra.  Arguments from analogy are very 
common in everyday reasoning and students will learn about these both from examples taken 
from their own lives as well as from texts such as Nagarjuna’s Mūla-madhyamaka-kārikā which 
abound with arguments from analogy.
Course 2: Knowledge and Scepticism
This course will be based on the classical Indian theory of knowledge, pramāṇa-śāstra, which is 
concerned with the idea of pramāṇa – how we come to have knowledge. We will explore the 
three main candidates for pramāṇa put forward by these ancient thinkers – perception, infer-
ence, and testimony – by putting them into dialogue with later voices in Western philosophy as 
well as contemporary issues. The focus will be on perception and testimony since inference will 
already be covered in the course on Reasoning. This course will show how ancient ideas can help 
us think better about current problems. 
How do we come to know anything at all? And how can we be certain of what we know? We live 
in an age where it seems that knowledge can be accessed by anyone with a smartphone – but is 
this real knowledge? The course will begin with the sceptical challenge to knowledge put for-
ward by Advaita Vedānta, Cārvāka, and Buddhist thinkers. 
The puzzle about problems around perception will be explored. The main puzzle here is whether 
the objects of perceptions are internal to the perceiver, as Yogācāra subjectivism has it,  or exter-
nal to them, as Kumārila Bhaṭṭa argues in his commentary on the Mīmāṃsā-sūtra. Furthermore, 
how can we distinguish illusions from veridical perceptions? A lively debate between Prābhāka-
ra Mīmāṃsā and Nyāya will help in getting a firmer grasp on this problem.
464
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
The course will end by focusing on the problems of trust, testimony, and expert knowledge. How 
do we know whom to trust when even experts can’t agree on a given issue? How can we trust 
some witnesses as believable and others as not in a court of law?  On what grounds can we judge 
that a given website or news source is biased?
Course 3: Ethics
This course will introduce students to ethical reasoning as a way of thinking about moral issues 
that they face in day-to-day life. This will help students understand ethical dilemmas by showing 
them normative ways of thinking about these issues. The goal, as with all the philosophy courses, 
is to give students the ability to be practical problem solvers and to find ways to think rigorously 
about moral problems that they might encounter in their everyday lives. In addition, students 
will be encouraged to think about what it is to live an ethical and virtuous life themselves. 
This will be done through an introduction to ethical writing from both Indian tradition (Buddhist 
thought, stories from Panchatantra, Jataka, Hitopadesh, Puruşārthasiddhyupāya) and the West-
ern tradition.  The focus will be on helping students understand what the moral thing to do is in 
a given situation. Students will be introduced to these issues through everyday issues like cheat-
ing, violence, plagiarism, littering, tolerance, equality, and empathy. Students will be expected to 
apply the tools introduced during the unit to these issues and analyse the relevant ethical dimen-
sions. The focus of the course will also be on understanding different points of view on any given 
issue and how to understand and respond to different positions that can be held with regard to 
the problem. This will enable students to take a multi-perspective approach to ethical reasoning, 
where they will be encouraged to develop their ethical views on these issues in cooperation with 
each other.  
The expected effect of this course will be to imbibe lifelong ethical thinking in students which 
should enable them to consider the ethical dimensions of various issues. A particular focus will 
also be to enable students to think about traditional Indian values, and values enshrined in the 
Constitution (such as seva, ahimsa, swachchhata, satya, nishkam karma, shanti, sacrifice, toler-
ance, diversity, pluralism, righteous conduct, gender sensitivity, respect for elders, respect for all 
people and their inherent capabilities regardless of background, respect for the environment, 
helpfulness, courtesy, patience, forgiveness, empathy, compassion, patriotism, democratic out-
look, integrity, responsibility, justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity) from an ethical point of 
view.
Course 4: Elective
The three core courses on reasoning, knowledge, and ethics develop the basic foundations for 
philosophical thinking. With this foundation, students can apply their philosophical thinking to 
specific problems in philosophy. Students can choose one of the many electives that can be of-
fered to focus on one of these specific problems. 
Elective 1: Philosophy of Mind
What exactly are we? What is the nature of the ātman? This was, along with questions about 
knowledge-acquisition, one of the most divisive questions in classical Indian philosophy. On the 
one hand, we have substance dualism, represented in the Upaniṇads and in the texts of the 
465
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Nyaya-Vaiśeṇika Darśana, according to which the self is an eternal immaterial substance. On 
the other hand, we have materialists, such as the Lokāyata Darśana, according to whom the 
self is no more than a conscious body. Some Buddhists deny that there even is such a thing as 
the self and argue that this illusory belief in ātman is the source of all suffering. In the contem-
porary context, these debates about the self end up being debates about personhood, the 
mind, and the brain. In this course, we will, once again, see how these ancient debates about 
the self can help us think about current issues around the mind, consciousness, and artificial 
intelligence. 
We’ll look at a range of arguments for various positions on what the mind is: something im-
material existing separately from our bodies, a very sophisticated computer software, etc.  We 
will then look at the question of whether individuals other than human beings have minds. 
Possible candidates for this are not only sophisticated computers and robots but also non-hu-
man living beings like animals. The Jainas believed that there were many kinds of jīva much 
as some philosophers today argue that it is not only humans who have minds. What are the 
implications of such a view?  How might cyborgs (persons enhanced by artificial body parts) 
fit into the picture? Given how intertwined human lives are with technology, might it make 
sense to think of ourselves as cyborgs already? Throughout, we will focus on arguments for 
and against each of these views as well as thinking about the social and ethical implications 
of these various stances on the nature of the mind or self.
Elective 2: Environmental Philosophy
Who is to blame for climate change? What exactly is the loss of biodiversity, and why is it bad? 
Is damage to the environment bad only because of its effects on humans, or does ethics reach 
beyond humanity? How should we change our political systems to take into account the rights 
of non-human animals? Is a carbon tax unfair to developing countries? The goal of this course 
is to use concrete case studies in order to think abstractly about these broader environmental 
issues. By the end of this course, students should have an idea of potential families of solu-
tions and answers as well as an understanding of how to adjudicate between these. 
A significant part of the course will be dedicated to the understanding of Indian and western 
philosophical perspectives on the environment. Students will be introduced to classical Indi-
an environmental ideas from Vedas, Upanishads, Charak Samhita, Matsya Purana, Panchtan-
tra, and Jataka. This will be supplemented by the modern Indian environmental philosophy 
of Gandhi, and Amartya Sen, as well as a close study of grassroots environmental movements 
like the Chipko Movement, Green Revolution, Navdanya.  
While the study will be grounded in these local ideas and movements, abstract concepts will 
be used to get clarity on terms that are often used and sometimes misused by climate activ-
ists, scientists, and policymakers. For example, the course would attempt to get clarity on 
what exactly ‘climate justice’ entails. While acknowledging the importance of sustainability, 
protecting biodiversity can be at odds with something like green energy and, if so, what are 
possible solutions to this problem? 
These different conceptualisations and their analysis will enable students to answer ques-
tions about the rights and status of non-human living beings, the status of ecosystems, the 
466
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
sustainability of the environment, how to deal with the crisis of climate change, and whose re-
sponsibility it is to mitigate the effects of climate change. The problems and questions that this 
course addresses are at the foundations of environmental science and environmental economics 
and also draw on environmental history. This course will be well suited to students with a broad-
er interest in environmental issues.
10.2.2 English Literature
10.2.2.1 Principles for Course Design
The English Literature discipline hopes to foster in students both critical and creative skills, and 
a deep love for literature in all its variety. Keeping in mind the challenges of studying English in 
the Indian context, students will encounter a breadth of literary texts from across India, many of 
them translated from Indian languages. Literature is the material means, the ‘subject-matter 
content’, for fluent oral and written communication. Immersion in the English language is an 
important focus of the Literature discipline. 
The courses will primarily be transacted through activities, encouraging students to engage with 
literature in a variety of ways. Students will learn to exercise their critical skills in listening, 
speaking, reading, and writing.  These exercises will build up capacities by increasing in depth 
and complexity over the four semesters. Writing will be a crucial component, used to help stu-
dents engage with and understand the language and the formal aspects of the texts; it will also 
be used as a tool for creativity and self-expression. All courses will have a significant project 
component, where students will learn to apply different capabilities in their study of literature, 
including reporting, conducting interviews and surveys, and writing reviews. While the courses 
in the discipline focus primarily on written texts, students choosing English Literature will be 
able to extend their critical and creative skills to other textual forms. 
The courses will offer reading selections grouped around possible themes of interest to second-
ary school students, including young adult and school life, environment, magic and wonder, sci-
ence fiction, and nature. 
10.2.2.2 Intended Learning Outcomes:
a. Read literary texts closely.
b. Identify the formal features of literary texts.
c. Demonstrate the ability to interpret texts.
d. Acquire creative and critical writing skills.
e. Cultivate a literary sensibility by engaging with a range of texts from diverse contexts.
f. Appreciate the richness and diversity of India through literary and cultural texts.
10.2.2.3 Pedagogical Approaches
Classes will be centred on reading, speaking and writing activities. Students will be invited to 
bring to class texts they find interesting and speak about them. These will include texts original-
ly written in languages other than English.
467
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
The pedagogy will be a mix of teacher-led and active-learning approaches. It will be mindful that 
engaging with literary works in the classroom serves multiple functions besides analysis, appre-
ciation, and exam-readiness. To that end, reading, writing, listening, speaking, and other study 
skills (such as reference, note-making, note-taking, mind maps) will be folded in with activities 
such as reading aloud, quizzes, pre-reading comprehension, freewriting, imaginative world-build-
ing, re-writing and parsing, vocabulary games, skits, journaling.
10.2.2.4 Illustrative Courses
The courses listed here will introduce students to a range of literary forms, and acquaint them 
with texts from India and abroad, both in English and in translation. All the courses will have 
project components and writing activities. Students who complete four Literature courses will 
have a portfolio of writing in different forms and styles. The fourth course outlines a deeper crit-
ical and creative writing engagement with one of the forms
Course 1: Reading Literature
Reading Literature is the first course in the English Literature discipline. Like the other courses 
in English Literature, this course trains students to interpret texts and communicate their under-
standing orally and in writing. The course begins by alerting students to the variety of written 
forms that are a part of our world—ranging from classical literary texts to newspapers and 
WhatsApp messages. Students are then introduced to prose and poetry from different periods of 
time and diverse cultural contexts. They will learn to identify the formal features of texts and 
their thematic concerns.
The element of play is a key classroom practice. Individually and in groups, students will rewrite 
texts by changing words, settings, beginnings and endings to understand how meanings are pro-
duced.
At the end of this course students should be able to a) recognize the form of an ’unseen’ written 
text and identify its features b) explain what its main themes are c) understand and use basic 
literary terms used in literary criticism.
Course 2: The Short Story and the Novel 
At the end of this course, students should be able to:
a. Recognize the contours and conventions of a variety of narrative forms. 
b. Demonstrate the ability to close read literary texts.
c. Demonstrate an understanding of the connectedness of literary forms.
d. Appreciate the richness and variety of non-western forms and the crucial role they have 
played in the development of the major western forms often emphasized in school syllabi. 
The course will introduce students to the idea of human beings as fundamentally narrative crea-
tures with an urge for “logical” conclusions and of storytellers as the first custodians of commu-
nity histories. Students will read some examples of short story precursors like the jest, the anec-
dote, the parable and the exemplum as well as some of their non-western counterparts including 
the Indian katha and qissa. The class will then move on to folk and fairy tales and the fable in 
both western and eastern traditions. Students will proceed next to the short story in its modern 
avatar, examining how it has developed out of earlier forms and reading four or five examples 
468
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
from various parts of the world. Among other questions, the class will inspect what fantasy 
means in the shorter genres, why realism came to take over the short story at a particular time, 
and why fantasy has made something of a comeback today. Students will then briefly learn about 
the history of the novel and read extracts from some early novels. Finally, the class will engage 
with a complete novel and analyze it in detail. Schools may choose between three or four title 
options. 
Course 3: Introduction to Poetry and Drama
This course will focus on Poetry and Drama, aiming to: 
a. Introduce students to key features of these genres and representative forms through a wide 
set of examples including works in translation; 
b. Explore strategies of reading, understanding, and writing about poetry and drama, including 
an introduction to basic literary-critical/analytical vocabulary; 
c. Help develop an appreciation of these forms in multiple cultures; 
d. Enable deeper immersion into english language skills through literature; 
e. Encourage students to express their ideas through their own written, spoken, sung and/or 
performed productions.
It is presumed that the students will have some experience working with literary texts in the 
classroom, including two preceding semesters of courses in literature. A direct engagement with 
the form, content and affect of the works themselves will be foregrounded over an author- and 
tradition-centric take on prescribed texts. Poetry-specific activities will direct students to note 
the relationships between words, sounds, affect, images and cultural contexts. Drama-centric 
activities will also include reflections on the continuity and differences between texts and per-
formances, on performance traditions closer home, and on the many spaces of performance (the-
atre, radio, streets, marketplaces, religious spaces, festivities, television, film, performance art, 
sketches etc.) Apart from summative assignments based on course modules, students will also 
undertake group projects/performances. 
Course 4: Reading and Writing: Poetry/Essay/Short Story/Drama
Occurring at the end of the student’s school careers, this course will concentrate on one of four 
forms chosen by the instructor. These are forms that students would already have some familiar-
ity with. Students who take this course will read more advanced texts in the form chosen and 
engage with them critically. Students will become familiar with the formal and structural ele-
ments of the chosen form, as well as with elements of its literary history and its adoption into 
different literary traditions in India and abroad. They will also engage in a series of writing exer-
cises that will help them gain familiarity with the form on a practical basis and explore the pos-
sibilities it offers for their own self-expression. The course encourages students to take owner-
ship of the chosen form and adapt it to suit their own contexts. The semester will culminate in a 
creative writing project where they will write their own stories, poems, essays, or plays.

Section 10.3 
Social Science
10.3.1 History
10.3.1.1 Principles for Course Design
The primary objective of the History curriculum at the higher secondary level is to inculcate a 
historical sensibility about our past. While at the secondary level, students learn history as a part 
of the larger conglomerate of Social Science, they are not exposed to the disciplinary founda-
tions, methodological tools, and comparative frameworks that mark a historical consciousness. 
This sequence of courses will ensure that students receive a strong grounding in the substantive 
content of Indian History while remaining aware of India’s place in the world.
10.3.1.2 Illustrative Courses
Course 1: Ancient World
This course will take a comparative and methodological approach towards understanding the 
prehistory and early history of the Indian subcontinent in the context of other parts of the world. 
It will cover the earliest peopling of the Indian subcontinent, followed by the spread of agricul-
ture in the fertile crescent and in South Asia, and the emergence of the earliest known cities and 
city-based civilizations in Mesopotamia, Egypt, and South Asia. The course will examine the an-
cient literary (mythological and religious) works produced in India, Greece, and Syria, as well as 
also cover the rise of new religions and philosophies in India and China. Methodologically, the 
course will introduce students to the basics of the archaeological and historical method and stu-
dents will learn how to interpret early literary texts as well as material culture to produce a his-
torical narrative.
Course 2: States and Empires in India
This course will introduce students to various kinds of large (and less large) and complex politi-
cal formations (such as states and empires) in India from about the 5th century to the 16th cen-
tury. The students will learn about the formation of more centralized state systems than those 
that existed in the previous periods, and critically examine the nature of these states, especially 
about the structures of power and levels of control over diverse geographies and communities. 
This course will also introduce students both to the widespread agricultural ecology and econo-
my in India, as well as to the Indian Ocean trade networks as well as the overland trade routes 
such as the Silk Road to see how India was deeply connected to the rest of the world in these 
times.
Course 3: Towards Modernity
This course will introduce students to the emergence of modernity, both as a temporal period as 
well as a concept, especially in the context of Europe. The course will discuss the transforma-
tions to modern cultural, state, and economic institutions in Europe. In the cultural realm, Eu-
470
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
rope witnesses several key transformations, including the Renaissance and Reformation, the 
Scientific Revolution, Humanism, and the emergence of the nation-state. Economic aspects of 
modernity included the emergence of mercantilism and the concurrent search for the New 
World, the Industrial Revolution, and the spread of capitalism and colonialism. While the course 
will focus on key historical transformations in Europe, it will also consider the impact these 
transformations had on the rest of the world, especially in America, Africa, and Australia.
Course 4: Birth of the Nation
This course will chart the emergence of colonial rule in India, from the 16th century, when the 
first European joint stock trading company arrived in India, to the birth of the nation-state in 
1947, extending the moment of this birth up to the integration of princely states and the adop-
tion of the Constitution by our Republic in 1950. The course will familiarize students with the 
struggle between European colonial powers for control over various parts of India, and the var-
ious forms of Indian resistance, including peasant and Adivasi resistance movements. The course 
will also introduce students to the vast administrative, educational, and social and reforms that 
were effected during the colonial period. The final part of the course will discuss India’s freedom 
struggle and will include not only its well-known figures but also some lesser-known figures of 
the struggle.
10.3.2 Sociology
10.3.2.1 Principles for Course Design
The courses on Sociology will help students to understand society as a form of reality. This is a 
level of human existence which exists both within and beyond the individual. The courses will 
enable students to better understand their own selves and the social institutions and structures 
which shape their lives. There will be an emphasis on doing Sociology rather than only reading 
it, through case-studies, projects, inquiry-based learning and so on, so that students begin to 
build their own understanding of their environment. The courses will offer reflexive, analytical 
and emancipatory ways of seeing their world. They will also enable students to grasp our shared 
humanity across all the variation which occur in different social locations. Understanding how 
gender, material conditions and social groups and identities shape our subjectivities permits one 
to start building greater intersubjectivities. The courses will emphasize a reflexive approach to 
Sociology, where students also become aware of different ways of seeing society, including from 
western and Indian perspectives and from different social locations within India. The courses 
are oriented towards connecting Sociological knowledge to understandings, actions, and strate-
gies in the everyday world as well as in building strategies for structural change.
10.3.2.2 Illustrative Courses
Course 1: Introduction to Sociology
This course will introduce the Sociological perspective by exploring certain social patterns which 
are fundamental to life in the contemporary era. These would include institutions like the family, 
marriage, and kinship. They would also include the growth of capitalism, rationalization, indus-
471
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
trialism, and the state. Students would be introduced to sociological ways of understanding var-
ious forms of ethnicity and nationalism. Through these the basic concepts and methods of So-
ciology would be learned like roles, norms, social structures, culture and so on. Students would 
introduce to some basic research methods of Sociology and how Sociological knowledge is con-
structed. A “Sociological imagination” would thus be learned through which students will be able 
to see their selves within a broader changing social context. 
Course 2: Social structure, identity, and self in India
Students would be introduced to the study of India’s social structure and how to connect it with 
patterns of subjectivity like the formation of the self and identity. They would learn to look at 
these from functionalist, conflict, and interpretivist perspectives. Important aspects of India’s 
social structures would be introduced, including the differences between rural and urban social 
life. The main body of the course would deal with social structures that can lead to social in-
equalities and/or diversities like gender, sexuality, class, caste, tribe and religion. Their histori-
cally changing contours would be studied along with the social forces changing them. The social 
construction of the self and various kinds of identities would be discussed along with the rela-
tion between the micro and the macro in social life.  The ways in which agency operates to change 
social structure as well as the ways in which social structures affect our subjectivity would be 
discussed. 
Course 3: Politics, state, and development in India
Politics is a way of a deciding between contending points of view and can be a way of reconciling 
them or asserting one over the other. Students would be introduced to the institutions and cul-
tures involved in making decisions related to social life in India. They would also learn about 
various social forces that act to influence politics. The state is one of the major institutions which 
balances and decides between conflicting voices. Different approaches to the state would be in-
troduced along with the challenges of bureaucratization. Democracy would be discussed as a 
way of connecting the state with different interest groups and social forces. Its trajectory in India 
would be explored along with challenges to it. Social movements would be discussed as a way of 
exerting pressure from outside the established system of power, which can provide an important 
corrective impulse. 
The relation between politics, the state and the economy would be introduced. Students would 
learn the different ways in which humans adapt to their environment and to their systems of 
production, distribution, and consumption. Capitalism as the pre-eminent contemporary way of 
organizing this would be discussed, along with the challenges it poses. The changing and con-
tested role of the state in guiding this would also be discussed, along with different views on 
privatization. The trajectories of development in India and its experience by different social 
groups would be studied. The impact of globalization on the state, culture and the economy 
would be traced. 
472
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Course 4: Sociology of Culture: mass media, education, and religion
This course would be about the importance of culture in human existence and the different insti-
tutions which shape and contest it. The major ways of understanding culture would be intro-
duced, including culture as the entire way of life of a community and culture as a code of symbols 
and practices. The multi-layered and overlapping character of culture would be illustrated 
through different examples in the mass media, where there exist many voices at the same time. 
The politics of culture would be introduced through ideas of hegemony and counter-hegemony 
in the mass media. Cultural power and the assertion of particular interpretations as a method of 
domination would be explored through examples of communities, castes, religions, languages 
and so on. Status groups and their politics would be discussed. Connected with this would be the 
problem of social location and objectivity in knowledge.  
The Sociological perspective on culture would be deepened through the study of education and 
religion. The functions of religion in social life would be introduced along with its contested re-
lation with other social structures and processes like the family, gender and politics. The social 
and cultural processes changing religion would be explored. The functions of education along 
with interpretivist and conflict perspectives on education would be introduced through exam-
ples from India. A particular focus would be to understand differences in educational access and 
achievement in India.

10.4.1.1 Principles for Course Design
“The present volume is the first-time presentation of the integrated biology for the school level chil-
dren. ... The integration achieved however, is partial and not complete. Hopefully along with chang-
es in the teaching and learning context, to be brought out in the next few years, the next edition of 
this book will reveal more integration of botany, zoology and microbiology and truly reflect 
the true nature of biology”

In designing the curriculum for the biology discipline, the following general principles were ad-
hered to:
a. Greater integration and highlighting of interconnectedness: In line with the quote 
mentioned above, an attempt has been made to accomplish greater integration of different 
fields of biology. In addition, the interconnections between different fields are explicitly 
highlighted along with the importance of having a multi-pronged approach to studying life 
sciences. This naturally leads to a balance between breadth and depth in covering different 
topics. Students will be able to explore biology at different scales, have an appreciation for 
the process of science and the progression of scientific ideas, and have the capacity to 
engage more deeply with any field of interest. They will also be aware of bioethical concerns 
that arise in biology today.
b. Biology in context: Biology has a reputation for being descriptive and students often have 
to remember many facts without having any context. This produces students who have a lot 
of factual knowledge but are ill-equipped to meet the challenges of modern life sciences. In 
order to align school education with current practices in life sciences, the content has been 
streamlined. Whenever description-heavy content is included, an attempt has been made to 
provide appropriate context. The reduction in content and the emphasis on context will 
allow more creative and immersive pedagogic practices as students can relate to what is 
being taught.
c. Flexibility: The biology curriculum is designed to be self-contained and does not assume 
that students will be taking courses in other science disciplines. This will allow students to 
have the flexibility envisaged by the choice-based system.
d. Skill Enhancement: The curriculum is designed to encourage students to go beyond 
bookish knowledge by promoting capacities for observation, documentation, and familiarity 
with quantitative reasoning and multi-disciplinary approaches. Assessments will also be 
designed to enhance higher cognitive skills and minimize the reliance on rote-learning.

e. Future possibilities for students: The curriculum makes a concerted effort to highlight 
diverse careers in the life sciences. Even if students do not go on to pursue careers in life 
sciences, the curriculum will engender a sensitivity to biological issues (environment, 
health, etc.) in their surroundings and create an awareness of how citizens can contribute to 
their local communities and to science.
Keeping these principles in mind some illustrative course descriptions have been outlined be-
low. 
10.4.1.2 Illustrative Courses
Course 1: Biodiversity and Biogeography of India
This course will begin with an overview of the scope of life sciences, the various length and time 
scales at which biological phenomena occur and the methods employed by scientists to investi-
gate these phenomena. Students will be encouraged to think like a scientist using case studies 
from India. They will develop an appreciation for natural history and an understanding of biodi-
versity and the factors which affect the richness and diversity of life in different regions. A broad 
exposure to biodiversity in India will be complemented by a deeper exploration of biodiversity 
in their local region and an introduction to systematic practices of studying biodiversity through 
taxonomy and nomenclature. The course will conclude with units on the impact of climate change 
and the importance of conservation efforts. Through the theme of biodiversity and biogeogra-
phy, students will develop general capacities for quantitative reasoning (interpretation of graphs, 
computation of summary statistics) as well as observation skills through activities requiring 
them to identify and classify species in their surroundings. Students will also be made aware of 
careers in ecology, sustainability and other allied fields and how citizens can contribute to scien-
tific research.
Course 2: The Unity of Life
This course will highlight the common structures and processes that underpin all of biology. The 
Unity of Life will begin with a discussion of cell theory and our current understanding of cellular 
structures and processes. Subsequently, students will explore important classes of molecules 
that are constituents of cells and the functions they perform. In this context, students will learn 
about the identification of DNA as the genetic material. This will be followed by a historical ac-
count of genetics and how fundamental principles of heredity were identified by Mendel and 
rediscovered later. An essential aspect of this course will be a discussion of how evolutionary 
processes can provide a framework for investigating biological phenomena across scales. This 
will involve an overview of the development of the theory of evolution by natural selection 
through the work of Darwin and Wallace, a discussion of the modern synthesis, and an introduc-
tion to phylogenetics through the study of the tree of life. The course will conclude with an intro-
duction to molecular biology (Central Dogma, Genetic code) and gene regulation. The Unity of 
Life will use case studies (e.g. antimicrobial resistance) to illustrate the importance of an inte-
grated understanding of biological systems in modern life sciences. Through this course, stu-
dents will become familiar with concepts that are essential to study any biological system. They 
will also appreciate that scientific theories and ideas take time to develop and that there is value 
in understanding the historical context of their origin.

Course 3: Organismal Biology (or) Agriculture and Animal Husbandry
The third course in Biology can be a choice between Organismal Biology and Agriculture and 
Animal Husbandry.
a. Organismal Biology
Organismal Biology will adopt an evolutionary framework to cover many aspects of the biol-
ogy of non-human organisms (microbes, fungi, plants, animals). It will begin with representa-
tive examples of development and simple illustration of the genetics of body plans. Thereaf-
ter, the course will explore a small set of topics related to the physiology and anatomy of 
plants and animals. The major portion of the course will cover topics in ecology and the biol-
ogy of food production. This includes population, community and behavioural ecology, ener-
gy flows, and the interaction between different species. A diverse set of examples (spanning 
the tree of life) will be used to illustrate concepts. With regard to food production, the course 
will focus on food security (including challenges of climate change and diseases, the role of 
biotechnology) and sustainability (resource use, environmental impact). Students will be en-
couraged to draw connections between food security challenges and physiological and eco-
logical constraints. This course will allow students to appreciate how an evolutionary frame-
work sheds light on different phenomena in organismal biology. It will also allow students to 
synthesize topics covered in the previous two courses.
b. Agriculture and Animal Husbandry
This course is designed to be an alternative to Organismal Biology and will cover the same 
topics from a perspective that will appeal to students whose family livelihoods depend on 
agriculture. Agriculture and Animal Husbandry will begin with an exploration of commercial-
ly important organisms along with some examples of the developmental biology, anatomy 
and physiology of these organisms. The role of breeding and biotechnology will be discussed 
followed by ecological and environmental constraints and challenges to food production. The 
course will conclude with the topic of disease management and the possibilities of biocontrol. 
Through this course, students will recognize why an understanding of physiology and an eco-
logical sensibility is essential for sustainable food production. As with Organismal Biology, 
students will engage with topics in the previous two courses and their role in food produc-
tion.
Course 4: Human Biology
The final course will appeal to the innate interest that most biology students have in understand-
ing themselves. Human Biology will begin with a brief discussion of the evolutionary history of 
the genus Homo and the human genome project. Thereafter, it will cover major organ systems in 
a manner that connects with discussions of the genome and concepts of physiology and evolu-
tion covered in previous courses. A substantial portion of the course will be devoted to health 
and well-being. After discussions on the importance of diet and nutrition, an overview of com-
municable and non-communicable diseases will be provided. Coverage of diseases will be ac-
companied by methods of preventive care, diagnosis, biology behind administering medication 
and treatments, and the role of pharmaceutical companies. Given the age group, concerns of re-
productive health, mental health, substance abuse, and addiction will be explored. Students will 
be made aware of many careers related to human health. The course will conclude with students 
exploring the connection between individual health and planetary health and why one must 
view health from a community perspective rather than just an individual one.

10.4.2 Chemistry
10.4.2.1 Principles for Course Design
The study of Chemistry should be more than learning and remembering the properties of chem-
icals. Equipping students with tools to begin understanding how chemistry works is more im-
portant than knowledge of the facts of chemistry. Courses at this level must deal with content at 
an appropriate level of rigor in order to develop the necessary conceptual foundations in stu-
dents and, at the same time, equip students with an overview that is a sufficiently broad intro-
duction to the subject.
The primary goal of the curriculum outlined here is to progressively build a clear framework that 
gives a coherent overview of chemistry as a subject, explains why it matters, and shows how 
different areas of content are connected. In order to impart a ‘big picture’ with adequate concep-
tual rigour the content of the curriculum is built around the core cross-cutting themes of Chem-
istry shown in Figure X; Structure, Analysis, Transformations, and Modelling.
Further, chemical phenomena can be understood and represented at three levels. At the macro-
scopic level, it is about the properties and transformations in substances that we can observe. 
Chemistry interprets these observations in terms of the rearrangements of atoms and electrons. 
This is the molecular level – the underlying structure of all matter that we cannot see directly. 
The third symbolic level of chemical symbols, formulae and reaction schema is what chemists 
use to describe chemical phenomena and link the macroscopic and molecular levels together. It 
is essential to build a certain amount of comfort with using all three levels of representation at 
this stage of education to enable both preparation for higher education as well as a transition 
from rote learning enumerated facts in a fragmented way to developing the skills necessary to 
begin to identify patterns and form connections that underlie all chemical phenomena. Curricu-
lum content must ensure that students have, and recognize they have, appropriate intellectual 
resources and know how to connect these resources as they construct and revise explanations or 
predictions.

Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
The first course in the curriculum starts at the molecular level with a discussion of atomic struc-
ture and chemical bonding. Instead of structure in terms of abstract and intangible concepts 
only, the course relates structure to observable properties in the laboratory and in the real world.
The subsequent courses build on this foundational understanding to examine transformations 
of chemical substances. The final course uses the concepts built through the three courses and 
exposes students to some applied aspects of Chemistry.
At the end of the final course, students should recognize that chemists are uniquely qualified to 
contribute meaningfully to frontier research areas related to climate change, environmental is-
sues, materials science, biology and medicine.
10.4.2.2 Illustrative Courses
Course 1: Structure, Bonding, and Properties in Chemistry
The insight chemistry gives to the student is one that unifies phenomena at the molecular scale 
to those of the astronomical. Structure, Bonding and Properties in Chemistry is the first of a se-
ries of 4 courses in the curriculum. The course develops a perspective that sees the universe as 
a collection of fundamental particles and their combinations. Eventually building on these to the 
realisation that properties of materials, compounds and molecules of life are all consequences of 
the fundamental principles that chemistry establishes.
Molecules are invisible to the eye. However, the effects of their existence are observable at the 
macroscale. The connection between the invisible molecules and the visible tangible conse-
quences is not obvious to the learner. Through this course, the interconnectedness of structure 
to bonding patterns and thereby their influence on observable properties are elucidated. The 
connections are explicitly made and woven into the units as an integral part. As concepts are 
accumulated, the connections to the real world are progressively more comprehensive. This 
model fundamentally removes the inherent abstraction in chemistry via observations of the 
wonders of science that the student can see, smell, hear, taste and touch.
The course begins with the structure of the atom and its electronic distributions. The classifica-
tion of elements in the periodic table and their periodic properties are elaborated. Building on 
these principles, the combination of elements to form compounds, the nature of these bonds and 
molecular geometry are detailed. To illustrate principles of structure and bonding hydrocarbons 
and their functional groups are introduced alongside their variations in connectivity and spatial 
arrangement via isomerism and the structure-property relationships in transition metal com-
plexes are included.
Course 2 and 3: Principles of Reactivity – I and II
This series of two courses focus on the study of chemical systems; how and why the reactions 
occur- drawing upon the properties of elements, bonding and structure learned previously. The 
two courses focus on the application of submicroscopic models of matter and structure-proper-
ty relationships to explain, predict, and control chemical behaviour. Students are introduced to 
478
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
concepts regarding chemical thermodynamics, acid-base equilibria and chemical kinetics from 
the perspective of the transformation of matter and the underlying principles that govern the 
reactivity of chemical substances. These courses use reactions of both organic and inorganic 
compounds to illustrate the concepts of enthalpy, free energy, equilibrium and kinetics of reac-
tions. They cover the patterns of reactivity in organic and inorganic systems, functional group 
chemistry, kinetics, mechanisms, and catalysis. They initiate the systematic study of the common 
classes of organic compounds, emphasising theories of structure and reactivity.
The course should enable the students to consider and measure the energies, and rates of the 
chemical reactions and to predict the products. At the end of the two courses, students should be 
able to connect observations of chemical reactivity at the macroscopic level with the changes at 
the molecular level and use principles studied in the courses to predict reactions and use these 
reactions to make modifications to small molecules.
Course 4: Modern Applications of Chemistry
Students choose Chemistry at a higher secondary stage with an aspiration to pursue basic, ap-
plied or professional courses after school. It is, therefore, essential to provide learners with 
meaningful contexts in their life and provide a ‘big picture’ of Chemistry. This course offers a 
space to integrate the essential concepts learned in previous courses with applications of chem-
istry, thereby enabling students to realize the interrelatedness of Chemistry, Society and Tech-
nology.
This course consists of four units covering modern applications of chemistry. The first unit is 
devoted to synthetic approaches, analytical methods, and structure-property relationships of 
some vital chemicals needed or used in our daily lives in addition to the analysis of their impact 
on the environment. This includes natural substances such as biological macromolecules as well 
as anthropogenic chemicals such as drugs, food substances, colourants and cosmetics. It also 
includes a structural understanding of inorganic and hybrid materials. The second unit looks 
into classification, preparation methods, applications and the environmental concerns of poly-
mers. The third unit provides insight and information on fuels and energy and how chemistry 
contributes to sustainable energy technologies. The last unit focuses on the structure and be-
haviour of chemical compounds contributing to the biomedical and agricultural fields. The sec-
ond part of this unit applies fundamental chemical principles studied in the second and third 
courses to industrial manufacturing processes.
10.4.3 Physics
10.4.3.1 Principles for Course Design
The teaching of Physics must integrate theory and experiment in equal measure. The experi-
ments should be set up with materials that are easily accessible and must not require any sophis-
ticated lab equipment. It is important that every physics student has experiential learning of the 
subject at the senior secondary level. The student should be able to relate their own experiences 
to what is transacted in the classroom. Ideally, a physics student will take a sufficient number of 
mathematics courses, since the description of the laws and phenomena of physics require math-
ematical formalism. This becomes even more important when solving problems in physics. How-
ever, the courses proposed below do not assume a knowledge of mathematics beyond what is 
479
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
taught until tenth grade. Topics in mathematics such as calculus, vector analysis, and trigonom-
etry are included as and when necessary in the courses. A good understanding of physics re-
quires sufficient time to be spent by both the teacher and the student. Therefore, we propose 
that the core consists of 4 courses. Students who desire to take courses in physics beyond the 
required four have the choice of two electives. These electives will expose students to modern 
breakthroughs in physics that have led to the emergence of several technologies, many of which 
we encounter in our daily lives. The interdisciplinary nature of physics will also be emphasised 
in these elective courses.
The four core courses are Mechanics, Electricity and Magnetism, Waves and Optics, and Thermo-
dynamics and Properties of Matter. They can be taken in the order listed below. Alternative se-
quences and some possible changes to the structure of the courses are listed at the end of this 
section.
10.4.3.2 Illustrative Courses
Course 1: Mechanics
This course in Mechanics is accessible to students who have done mathematics only up to the 
tenth grade. The course does not assume a knowledge of calculus and the necessary mathemat-
ical background is included as and when necessary through the concepts in physics. The content 
of the course will be kept simple and after an introduction to units and dimensions will focus on 
the essential concepts related to motion in one and two dimensions, force and mechanical work, 
various forms of energy, and the conservation of energy illustrated through various examples. 
Differential calculus will be taught as part of the unit on motion. Some notions of energy and 
length scales in matter will be discussed through examples in everyday life thus introducing 
them briefly to some of the modern ideas in condensed matter and biological physics. Applica-
tions of these concepts to other disciplines will be emphasized through various examples. Here 
the focus will be on giving a hands-on experience and relating this to the phenomena in everyday 
life.
Course 2: Electricity and Magnetism
‘Electricity and Magnetism’ seeks to give a broad overview of the main phenomena, including the 
historically significant experiments starting from Gilbert’s work on static electricity and proper-
ties of magnets to Hertz’s experiment confirming the existence of electromagnetic waves. Relat-
ed theoretical ideas will also be covered, along with familiarising students with basic experimen-
tal techniques and relevant foundational mathematical concepts. For example, students will 
learn the techniques of basic integral calculus that is needed for understanding and applying 
Gauss’ Law and Ampere’s Law. The course will help students appreciate the links between all the 
above aspects and to understand certain everyday natural phenomena and technologies from 
the lens of the physical principles that it discusses. The course will take the approach of balanc-
ing discussion of content and opportunities for synthesis and application. 
480
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Course 3: Waves and Optics
This course builds on ideas developed in Mechanics, and Electricity and Magnetism. This will 
involve both building a connection between various topics in physics and also a bit of repetition 
of those topics, which will help students assimilate and appreciate various phenomena. Topics 
include the pendulum and spring-mass system as simple harmonic oscillators, basic acoustics, 
Doppler effect, ray optics and optical instruments, and finally ideas in wave optics including in-
terference and diffraction.
Course 4: Thermodynamics and Properties of Matter
This course is a coherent and integrated handling of thermodynamics, properties of materials 
and some topics that would traditionally be covered in a “modern physics” course. These topics 
are essential core topics in the physics curriculum, but each need not take up the length of an 
entire course. This is the practical rationale for clubbing these areas together in a single course. 
The educational rationales are many:
a. These areas must be seen as the study of collections of particles and hence will build on the 
foundation of mechanics,
b. Basic gas laws such as the law of Avogadro are our first evidence of the existence of atoms, 
and
c. Thermodynamics predominantly deals with energy and energy transfer, which will also 
include radiation as a mode of energy transfer.
The course will include hydrostatics, motion of fluids, ideal gas laws, laws of thermodynamics, 
phase changes, modes of heat and energy transfer including blackbody radiation, and the photo-
electric effect.

Section 10.5 
Mathematics and Computing
The Mathematics and Computing curricular area would offer disciplinary choices in Core Math-
ematics, Business Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science and so on. Here, an illustration of 
Core Mathematics is outlined.
10.5.1 Core Mathematics
10.5.1.1 Principles for Course Design
Core Mathematics Education Grades 11 and 12 play an important role in equipping students 
with the necessary skills for participating in society and the economy. It is also a preparation for 
students who go on to university, in terms of enabling the transition to abstract and applied 
mathematics, depending on the choice of discipline. This is a stage when students are becoming 
young adults, being called upon to make autonomous choices, and mathematics plays a critical 
role in being a requirement for many pathways ahead. In Indian reality, education provides the 
sole instrument for breaking out of poverty for a large section of society, and mathematical pro-
ficiency plays a significant role in this regard.
Thus, mathematics education takes on the responsibility of developing the resources of students 
towards developing the capacity to think logically and analytically, and at the same time, discov-
er their own strengths and interests. Working autonomously and together with other students is 
important at this stage, and curricular opportunities are to be provided for such engagement. 
The courses below attempt to provide a range of such educational experiences, keeping in mind 
the crucial equity considerations underlying the reality of Indian school education. The core 
principles around which these courses have been designed are:
a. While engaging with the content areas of mathematics such as algebra and geometry, engage 
students in mathematical processes such as reasoning, modelling, visualisation, problem 
solving and formal communication. 
b. Develop an appreciation of the structure of mathematics as a discipline, making connections 
between areas of mathematics as well as with other disciplines of study. Introduce powerful 
ideas of mathematics such as infinite sums, limits and probability towards developing a 
deeper understanding of mathematics as a discipline.
c. Develop a healthy predisposition to formal problem solving as an opportunity to promote 
self-learning and reflection, as well as application of concept learning.
Over four semesters, students are exposed to a structure that centralises problem solving with 
concepts, skills, processes and metacognition supporting such a focus. They progress in the con-
tent areas of number systems, algebra, geometry and trigonometry, and are introduced to coor-
dinate geometry, calculus and probability and statistics. New representations are learnt which 
help students make connections between algebra and geometry.
These courses offer exposure to a range of mathematical concepts while providing a set of essen-
482
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
tial analytical skills and an in-depth understanding of a few selected themes. Necessarily this 
involves selection and exclusion among possible topics.
All the courses offer formal problem-solving opportunities, and in fact, the foundation course 
can be entirely problem-based. The student is exposed to a range of problems in the courses, 
calling for different approaches and solution techniques. A detailed syllabus will need to consid-
er opportunities for integrated and open-ended problems that help students use many content 
areas at the same time.
Modelling is not separately signalled in the curriculum, but all three courses from the second 
semester provide curricular opportunities for modelling, and it is hoped that the detailed sylla-
bus utilises them to engage students in modelling exercises.
10.5.1.2 Illustrative Courses
Course 1: Mathematical Foundations
This course introduces the student to mathematical reasoning and enables the student to both 
understand the need for proof as well as what constitutes a proof. A powerful proof technique, 
the principle of mathematical induction, is introduced. Students learn the language of sets, func-
tions and relations. A range of functions that students have already encountered (in algebra, 
geometry and trigonometry) are revisited, to understand domain and range in each case.
Course 2: Algebra and Geometry
Students learn to go back and forth between geometric objects on the plane and their algebraic 
expressions. Linear equations and their solutions are related to their geometric visualisation. 
Their representation by matrices provides a powerful tool for computation and helps the transi-
tion to three dimensions. Geometric objects such as parabolas, ellipses, circles and hyperbolas 
are studied as loci of points in motion.
Course 3: Calculus
An informal understanding of the notion of limit leads to a similar notion of continuity, which is 
adequate to understand the mathematics of motion, rate of change, etc. Students learn the gradi-
ent of a curve at a point, and the notion of second derivative, with its application to maxima 
minima problems. Integration is understood as the reverse process of differentiation. Students 
learn to evaluate definite integrals and use this to compute the area of a region bounded by a 
curve and lines parallel to the axes.
Course 4: Probability and Statistics
Students learn to select between ways of representing raw data (and explain why). They learn to 
use measures of central tendency and variation and use these to compare two sets of data. They 
learn permutations and combinations, and to use them in calculating probabilities of events. The 
notion of sample space is introduced and students learn to set up one. The basic laws of proba-
bility, independence of events and conditional probability are learnt.

Arts
The art courses in Grades 11 and 12 aim to achieve more depth in a chosen art form, while also 
providing students flexibility to explore related areas of study. Syllabus developers can design 
course packages for Grades 11 and 12 based on the arts and culture of their region, and by con-
sidering the resources and infrastructure that can be set in place for these programmes to oper-
ate efficiently. 
The choice of art courses offered can be spread across two categories:
a. Courses in Arts Practice: These courses could be for students who are interested in arts 
practice as well as those who wish to pursue arts practice in higher education or as a career. 
The design of all these courses in arts practice would continue to place importance on 
embodied and experiential learning through the making, thinking, and appreciation 
processes. Emphasis would be on rigorous practice in a chosen arts discipline. The content 
of the courses would also link practice to theory, art history, and contemporary issues that 
are relevant to each art form.

b. Courses in Arts Appreciation and Management: These could be suitable for students who 
may not be interested in art-making but are interested in arts appreciation, art history, 
conservation, curation and cultural event management. The courses in this category are 
structured so that students develop their knowledge of art history and aesthetics, while also 
refining their skills of interpretation, writing, documentation, community engagement and 
organisation thereby ensuring a meaningful appreciation for the arts.

10.6.1 Certification in the Arts
Students who choose Arts as one of their choice-based set of courses would need to decide 
whether they are specializing in a form (visual arts, theatre, music, dance and movement) and 
category (arts practice or arts appreciation). Based on this choice students have to choose a 
‘package’ of four courses that has three courses in one category and the fourth course in another. 
This is to ensure that the student gain breadth in both arts appreciation and arts practice while 
allowing them to go deeper into one the categories. 
An illustrated set of packages is outlined below.

Course 1: Drawing
Drawing serves as a foundation for a wide range of creative disciplines— painting, sculpture, 
architecture, visual communication, engineering, or fashion design. The ability to draw well con-
tributes in developing effective communication skills. Through this course students would learn-
ing key skills and techniques across artistic mediums and applications. 
Course 2: Sculpture
In this course, students would learn to develop their own artistic ideas and expression by creat-
ing sculptural objects. They would learn to refine their skills and techniques in any medium of 
their choice (clay, wood, fabric, mixed-media) through rigorous practice.
Course 3: Visual Arts in India (Past to Contemporary)
This course introduces students to the history of Indian Art through selective examples from 
pre-history to contemporary time. Every example would provide students an opportunity to 
study the aesthetic qualities of the artwork, as well as understand the social and cultural context 
of artists through history. Students would also have space to explore archives and find artwork 
or artefacts of importance on their own. Through this course, students would learn to interpret 
artworks, develop perspective and appreciate diverse artistic expressions.
Course 4: Textile Arts and Design
This course would introduce students to the world of textiles, and their diverse forms and func-
tions in our lives. Students can experiment with various materials, fibres, and fabrics; under-
stand their properties of colour, texture, insulation, opacity, longevity, etc., and explore their ap-
plications in multiple contexts (clothing, sports gear, safety gear, interior design, architecture, as 
a medium for artistic expression, etc.). Based on the local traditions, this course could introduce 
students to techniques of embroidery, knitting, weaving, applique, textile dyeing, and quilting.

10.6.3.1 Illustrative Courses
Course 1: Museums and Archives
This course introduces students to the importance of museums and archives in preserving and 
promoting art and culture. The course would involve a study of museum collections and their 
resources through visits to local museums as well as online resources of museums across India 
and the world. Students would also learn about the various processes of maintenance, conserva-
tion, research, and outreach programmes that museums undertake. The course would require 
students to work on their own project in designing, visualising and presenting a collection of 
artefacts, objects, or documents in their own imagination of a museum.
Course 2: Indian Classical Music Theory
This course introduces students to the philosophy, canons, and compositional structure that 
characterise different aspects of Indian music. Students would learn about different srutis and 
scales, frequencies of notes, arrangements of notes in raagas, emotions and rasas evoked through 
raagas, taal patterns, their styles and combinations, as well as important composers, music the-
orists and developments that have occurred in Indian classical music through history.
Course 3: Indian Folk Music
This course introduces students to practice folk genres from different parts of India. Through an 
exploratory practice, students would develop an understanding of musical styles, themes, in-
struments and performance techniques that are used in folk music.

Course 4: Portfolio Development
This course is meant for students who wish to pursue higher education or a career in the arts. 
While all courses would need students to maintain their portfolio, this course would introduce 
students to the concept, design,  and development of portfolios for the purpose of external view-
ership and in the context of college admissions and job applications.  Students would be exposed 
to various samples of portfolios to analyse their design, structure, content, and effectiveness in 
representing an artist’s work. Through such exercises, they would be guided to conceptualise 
their own portfolio, make selections from their existing portfolios, create new work to strength-
en their portfolio, write about their own motivations and ideas for their artworks, and develop 
its visual consolidation and presentation.

Physical Education
Physical education is a growing field in India and has the potential to grow a lot more. An in-
creasing number of citizens are taking health and wellness seriously and a lot more needs to be 
done to create awareness and provide avenues for people from all corners of our country to 
benefit from it. Through our education system, we need to provide a sound foundation of knowl-
edge in this field. There has always been a lot of interest in sports and fitness amongst children 
but with the right kind of courses and the creation of more educational avenues, we can give 
impetus to the wellness industry and thereby the health and well-being of the country. 
In Grades 11 and 12 of the Secondary Stage, we aim to cater to three broad categories of stu-
dents:
a. Students who want to continue sports and physical activity as a recreational activity and can 
also be nodal persons for physical educational knowledge for their community. These 
students might have pursued different activities up to the Secondary Stage but would not 
like to pursue a particular sport or take up different vocations of physical education. This 
group can be called PE for Community Wellness.
b. Students who are interested in taking up sports-based vocational opportunities in growing 
areas like sports education and fitness industry, sports management, sports analytics, 
sports psychology and even allied medical field like sports physiotherapy. This category can 
be called PE as a Vocation.
c. Students who are interested in taking up playing sports professionally or are interested in 
allied fields of professional sports. These are students who have already achieved some 
proficiency in a particular sport/game/practice like yoga or Tai chi at Secondary Stage. Such 
students will have the option to pursue it further, develop advanced skills and would like to 
compete at the highest level.  This category can be called PE for a Professional 
Sportsperson.
10.8.1 PE for Community Wellness
These courses are for students who are looking at sports more from a recreational and wellness 
point of view. They don’t want to pursue a particular sport or vocation of physical education. 
However, they do want to pursue physical education because of their interest and want to take it 
to the communities. The courses intend to build a foundation for understanding the different 
dimensions of physical education and wellness. The programme would also give an introduction 
to the domain, should the students wish to switch to playing a sport or any vocation of physical 
education in their higher education.   The courses on offer will prepare the students to lead 
healthy and active life. These are the courses that will be on offer.
10.8.1.1 Illustrative Courses
Course 1: Sports and Fitness – An Introduction
This course would start with basic human anatomy and physiology and its connection with 
physical activity and fitness. In addition, aspects of nutrition, injury prevention, and basic first 
aid would also be included in this course. 
490

Course 2: Community coaching (for a chosen sport)
This course prepares students to develop capacities for engaging in team sports for community 
development. Basic coaching skills relevant for the sport and the interconnection between devel-
oping life skills through team sports would be the focus of this course. 
Course 3: Sports and Fitness Advanced Basics
This course would build on the first course to go deeper into the practices required for strength 
and conditioning training. Maintaining strength, endurance, and flexibility is necessary for any 
sports or physical activity and this course would go deep into giving students the understanding 
of how to develop these capacities in others. The course would include the use of practices like 
yoga for developing strength and flexibility.
Course 4: Sports Management (basic)
This course would introduce students to the different aspects of managing teams for participat-
ing in sporting events. These sporting events are often important aspects of building a commu-
nity around sports. The course would focus on team management, event management, resource 
management (sourcing and maintaining equipment and playing areas), and some aspects of 
sports promotion – sponsorships, endorsements, and so on.
10.8.2 PE as a Vocation
These courses are for students who are interested in a vocation based on sports and fitness. 
Since this is a growing field, this could be one of the discipline options they take and can give 
students an introduction to various options available in sports, fitness and wellness domain. 
There are multiple growing areas in this domain so there will be a few elective options for stu-
dents to take under this.

[4 courses to be articulated]
10.8.3 PE for a Professional Sportsperson
These courses will be for students who are looking at becoming professionals under different 
sports or physical practices. Many of these students will already be undergoing coaching in their 
respective choice of sport and these courses will aid their development. Under this discipline 
again there will be 2 core courses and electives. The electives will be more specific to the sport 
or activity they have chosen.

Interdisciplinary Areas
10.9.1 Sustainability and Climate Change
10.9.1.1 Principles for Course Design
The interdisciplinary curriculum for Environmental education in the senior secondary stage 
(Class 11 & 12) will be called “Sustainability and Climate Change”. The courses under this will 
allow students to specialise in environmental topics they have been exposed to in the secondary 
stage and wish to pursue owing to their interest in environmental studies. The goal will be to 
enable deeper engagement with environmental science and explore the interconnectedness 
with sustainability and climate change grounded in the Indian context. 
Addressing environmental challenges requires an interdisciplinary perspective incorporating 
science, society, economy and politics. The curriculum for “Sustainability and Climate Change” 
will be developed using the social-environmental systems framework that conceptualises envi-
ronmental issues as complex, non-linear in cause and impact, subject to shocks and with tipping 
points. Central to the framework is equity and environmental justice which will be emphasised 
throughout the curriculum. 
The courses in the curriculum will range from environmental science, and linking science to so-
ciety, policy and economy. The curriculum will engage with sustainability and climate change 
challenges at different scales. Students will learn both about the need for and limitations of indi-
vidual versus systemic change and technological fix versus participatory action. They will also be 
involved in analysing case studies of successful interventions at different scales that have ad-
dressed environmental problems without being overwhelmed by the complexity of the challenge 
– an important learning for students. 
The objective of the course is to enable students to: 
a. Engage with complex environmental problems without being overwhelmed by it. 
b. Describe and summarise environmental challenges linking society and environment.
c. Understand trade-offs and ethical dimensions of sustainability and climate change 
challenges.
d. Contribute to environmental literacy enabling students to engage in environmental action.
492
Part B

10.9.1.2 Illustrative Courses
The four courses proposed under the curriculum are:
Course 1: Environmental Science from a Social-Environmental Systems Perspective 
Environmental challenges can no longer be addressed by traditional approaches where there 
was a clear separation of pure science and social science. As humans we are today an intrinsic 
part of our environment, and our actions are resulting in impacts on both environment and hu-
manity. In this course, students will study about the threats to the earth, the interconnected na-
ture of planetary boundaries,  thresholds that are breached, and explore using the systems per-
spective the tipping points. The course will emphasise how environmental sustainability requires 
going beyond individual behavioural change to requiring interventions at a systemic level. It will 
also enable students to understand how the use of technology alone, via new approaches to 
waste management or energy production, cannot completely address sustainability objectives, 
which require working adaptively with people, culture, markets and policies.  
Course 2: Environmental Pollution: Air
Air pollution is one of the major environmental challenges faced today with serious implications 
for human health. In this course students will be able to understand concepts around air pollu-
tion such as meteorology, composition (SPM, NOX, SOX etc)  and sources (industrial, vehicular 
etc). They will examine the effects of air pollution on plants, animals, as well as human health 
and economic implications, and issues of pollution and environmental justice. They will also ex-
amine air pollution control measures from technological to behavioural. 
Course 3: Biodiversity
In this course the students will start by refreshing concepts of biodiversity (ecosystems, species, 
natural landscapes etc), and why biodiversity is important for humans existence on this earth. 
They will then understand the threats to biodiversity and how this has affected the biodiversity 
at a global and national scale. The impacts of the loss of biodiversity linked to human depen-
dence will also be included. The course will provide a context to the history of biodiversity con-
servation, with a focus on critique of Indian legislations (laws, protected areas, community con-
servation etc.) and the implications. Students will also learn a few methods of documenting local 
diversity using tools such as citizen science and people’s biodiversity registers (PBRs).
Course 4: Climate Change 
Climate change is reshaping the world’s environment, with major implications for humanity in 
the coming decades. This course will introduce students to the science of the earth’s climate sys-
tem, and help students explore issues of climate justice. and changing weather patterns. This 
course will also introduce students to national and international agreements on climate change 
action, and to positive steps that can be taken for climate change adaptation and mitigation at 
different levels, from the national and international to the local level.

Grades 11 and 12 and Higher Education 
“The current nature of secondary school exams, including Board exams and entrance exams - and 
the resulting coaching culture of today - are doing much harm, especially at the secondary school 
level, replacing valuable time for true learning with excessive exam coaching and preparation. 
These exams also force students to learn a very narrow band of material in a single stream, rather 
than allowing the flexibility and choice that will be so important in the education system of the fu-
ture.” [NEP 2020, 4.36]
In recent decades in India, there has been an unfortunate trend to see Grades 11 and 12 as mere-
ly a means to gain admission into higher education. The curricular logic often gets twisted due to 
this instrumental thinking.  
The curricular logic of the NCF is oriented towards realizing the aims and goals for school educa-
tion. The learning standards, content, pedagogy, and most crucially the assessments are designed 
towards achieving these aims. It is a mistake to imagine the purpose of the Secondary Stage of 
schooling, particularly Grades 11 and 12, as a mechanism for selecting and sorting students for 
different programmes in higher education. This curricular logic is derived from the four funda-
mental principles articulated by NEP:
a. Flexibility, so that learners have the ability to choose their learning trajectories and 
programmes, and thereby choose their own paths in life according to their talents and 
interests;
b. No hard separations between arts and sciences, between curricular and extra-curricular 
activities, between vocational and academic streams, etc. In order to eliminate harmful 
hierarchies among, and silos between different areas of learning;
c. Multidisciplinarity and a holistic education across the sciences, social sciences, arts, 
humanities, and sports for a multidisciplinary world in order to ensure the unity and 
integrity of all knowledge;
d. Emphasis on conceptual understanding rather than rote learning and learning-for-exams;
The curriculum for Grades 11 and 12 is guided by these motivations, rather than as instrumental 
“preparation” for selection into higher education programmes.
The NEP 2020 has made a sincere attempt to delink the school education processes from the 
admissions processes of higher education.
“The National Testing Agency (NTA) will work to offer a high-quality common aptitude test, as well 
as specialized common subject exams in the sciences, humanities, languages, arts, and vocational 
subjects, at least twice every year. These exams shall test conceptual understanding and the ability 
to apply knowledge and shall aim to eliminate the need for taking coaching for these exams. Stu-
dents will be able to choose the subjects for taking the test, and each university will be able to see 
each student’s individual subject portfolio and admit students into their programmes based on in-
dividual interests and talents”. [NEP 2020, 4.42]
494
Part B
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
It has to be emphasized here that the specialized common subject exams envisaged by NTA 
should be broad in terms of focusing on the key conceptual structures and methods of investiga-
tion in the discipline. If these subject exams test narrow content knowledge, it would be mis-
aligned with the goals and approaches of the NCF.

 Values
(To be edited)
“The purpose of the education system is to develop good human beings capable of rational thought 
and action, possessing compassion and empathy, courage and resilience, scientific temper and cre-
ative imagination, with sound ethical moorings and values. It aims at producing engaged, produc-
tive, and contributing citizens for building an equitable, inclusive, and plural society as envisaged 
by our Constitution.” [NEP 2020, Principles of this Policy]
 “Students will be taught at a young age the importance of “doing what’s right”, and will be given a 
logical framework for making ethical decisions. In later years, this would then be expanded along 
themes of cheating, violence, plagiarism, littering, tolerance, equality, empathy, etc., with a view to 
enabling children to embrace moral/ethical values in conducting one’s life, formulate a position/
argument about an ethical issue from multiple perspectives, and use ethical practices in all work. 
As consequences of such basic ethical reasoning, traditional Indian values and all basic human and 
Constitutional values (such as seva, ahimsa, swachchhata, satya, nishkam karma, shanti, sacrifice, 
tolerance, diversity, pluralism, righteous conduct, gender sensitivity, respect for elders, respect for 
all people and their inherent capabilities regardless of background, respect for environment, help-
fulness, courtesy, patience, forgiveness, empathy, compassion, patriotism, democratic outlook, in-
tegrity, responsibility, justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity) will be developed in all students.” 
[NEP 2020, 4.28] 
“….ethics and human & Constitutional values like empathy, respect for others, cleanliness, courtesy, 
democratic spirit, spirit of service, respect for public property, scientific temper, liberty, responsibil-
ity, pluralism, equality, and justice” [NEP 2020, Principles of this Policy, p.5]
NEP 2020 makes an explicit commitment to the development of values. As stated in Part A, Chap-
ter 1 on Aims and Curricular Areas of School Education in this NCF, developing values and dispo-
sitions are critical to attaining the aims of education.

Section 1.1 
 How does development of values happen in   
 school?
Values are ethical positions. These reflect worldviews or ways of thinking. While there is overall 
consensus that education must develop values, there is equal recognition that this has been one 
of the hardest things to do systematically in formal educational settings. 
One critical way in which values are developed in school is through school and classroom culture 
(e.g., sensitivity and respect for others is encouraged when opportunities are provided for all 
students to participate in activities and select students do not end up participating in all activi-
ties) and school and classroom practices (e.g., regular bal sabhas and bal panchayats help to 
build notions of democracy, justice and equality). For more details, please see Part D, Chapter 1 on 
School Culture.
In this NCF, the development of values is an integral part of the learning standards and pedagog-
ical processes across all curricular areas. Illustratively, building resilience through learning to 
win and lose with grace in physical education or building scientific thinking through laboratory 
experiments and trials. 
The development of values is influenced by these school and classroom processes in a differen-
tiated manner as children grow, and therefore must be used appropriately at different Stages. 
Illustratively: At the Foundational Stage, playing together helps children learn to share. At the 
Preparatory Stage, the emphasis on completing given work and putting things away as a part of 
classroom practice helps good habit formation. At the Middle Stage, the emphasis on collabora-
tive group work as part of classroom practice helps develop the ability to work in teams. At the 
Secondary Stage, the emphasis on giving critical feedback on work done would help develop the 
ability to handle criticism and praise, success and failure with equanimity. 
It is also important to be conscious of the fact that each of these processes help to develop differ-
ent kinds of values. Some values are developed better through particular processes. Illustrative-
ly, regular dialogue and discussion with active listening as part of classroom culture and process-
es helps develop democratic values like pluralism, equality, justice, fraternity. Curricular areas 
like Arts and Physical Education help build individual virtues like honesty and courage). Curric-
ular areas like Science and Mathematics help build epistemic values like scientific temper and 
mathematical reasoning. Marking important days through community service as part of school 
culture and practices help build cultural values like seva, ahimsa, shanti). Regular practices at the 
school assembly help promote pride in India’s cultural diversity.

�Three�difficult�but�critical�questions

�
�
  
effective? 
This is a difficult question and has no direct, simple answer. Our experience so far across the 
country has been mixed. For most part, we have struggled to understand or execute it well in 
school. It has either become ‘boring’ or ‘preaching’ or an additional load on everybody resulting 
in very little impact. But we have not built a strong enough alternative approach either that can 
ensure that values have an important place in our everyday school processes.  
In this NCF, development of values is fully integrated into learning standards, pedagogical pro-
cesses and school and classroom culture. There is no separate time or class, or subject being 
proposed for value education at this point. 
But it may be worthwhile for individual schools, school systems and States to consider and rig-
orously address the following questions:
a. Are there specific values that need specific attention and, therefore, specified time? 
b. Should there be a different approach for different Stages? What would work best for each 
School Stage? E.g., Would children at the Secondary Stage benefit from a separate time for 
Values so that they are able to develop cognitive understanding and reasoning around these 
issues and learn to reflect better on their own behaviour?   
c. Can we develop Teachers with the capability to handle such sessions in a rigorous manner 
that is open and encourages respectful questioning and discussion? 
d. Can we develop interesting and rigorous material for teachers and children on this? 
Besides these considerations, the response to this question depends on how a separate subject/
class could be constructed, and what values are to be focused on for it.

Again, this question does not have a simple answer. 
Processes of dialogue and behavior which will demonstrate that conflicts and values are an inte-
gral part of human societies, and they need to be resolved through discussion and sustained ef-
fort will have to be built into classroom culture and practice.
Illustratively, when gender equality is encouraged in school, but children see the opposite within 
their families and communities, it would be critical for teachers to help children understand why 
there is a difference, support them to choose their actions and responses in a way that allows 
children to place their views before their families with reason and without disrespect and not 
give up easily.   
School culture and processes must emphasize respectful conversations and discussions, espe-
cially listening actively with an open mind and helping children arrive at positive and useful re-
sponses to their situations.  
1.2.3 Should�development�of�values�be�assessed?�If�yes,��
�
  
how?
This is also a question with no simple answer.
Developing values is a continuous process and is mostly contingent on the environment support-
ing and encouraging such development. Putting the onus of developing values on the child could 
take away this responsibility from the school and its processes.
On the other hand, developing values is a critical part of the education process and it is important 
to understand children’s development of values just as much as it is important to understand 
how much mathematics or language a child has learnt. 
Careful and objective observation would be critical to assessment of developing values. One way 
to think about this is to focus the assessment on the ‘behaviour’ that demonstrates the value just 
like actually adding two numbers demonstrates that a child is able to ‘do’ addition. Illustratively, 
‘Child A helps other children when there is a problem’ is a better way of articulating the learning 
rather than saying that a child has developed ‘empathy’ or ‘sensitivity.’ 
Part C

Section 1.3 
�Values�in�the�School�Ecosystem
Development of perspectives and capacities of educational functionaries, school leaders and 
Teachers on values is equally critical – their understanding of these values and building them 
into school culture and practices is what will make this happen. 
The culture of the education system must support the development of the same values otherwise 
there will be dissonance between what the system culture has and what is expected of the school. 
While these things are critical and will be alluded to in the NCF, they are matters outside the NCF 
- to the extent that some of these are relevant for the NCFTE, they will find a place.

 Inclusion
(To be edited)
“Education is the single greatest tool for achieving social justice and equality. Inclusive and equita-
ble education - while indeed an essential goal in its own right - is also critical to achieving an inclu-
sive and equitable society in which every citizen has the opportunity to dream, thrive, and contrib-
ute to the nation. The education system must aim to benefit India ’s children so that no child loses 
any opportunity to learn and excel because of circumstances of birth or background. This Policy 
reaffirms that bridging the social category gaps in access, participation, and learning outcomes in 
school education” [NEP 2020, 6.1] 
“Socio-Economically Disadvantaged Groups (SEDGs) can be broadly categorized based on gender 
identities (particularly female and transgender individuals), sociocultural identities (such as Sched-
uled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, OBCs, and minorities), geographical identities (such as students from 
villages, small towns, and aspirational districts), disabilities (including learning disabilities), and 
socio-economic conditions (such as migrant communities, low income households, children in vul-
nerable situations, victims of or children of victims of trafficking, orphans including child beggars 
in urban areas, and the urban poor).” [NEP 2020, 6.2] 
“recognizing, identifying, and fostering the unique capabilities of each student, by sensitizing teach-
ers as well as parents to promote each student’s holistic development in both academic and non-ac-
ademic spheres” [NEP 2020, Principles of this Policy, p.5]
Existing inequalities due to poverty, social bias, and exclusionary curricula create several road-
blocks in the process of achieving inclusive and equitable education through all through stages 
of school. Studies show that a large percentage of students who either drop-out of elementary 
school or discontinue their education after school belong to Socio-Economically Disadvantaged 
groups (SEDGs), which include gender identities (particularly female and transgender individu-
als), socio-cultural identities (such as Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, OBCs, and minori-
ties), geographical identities (such as students from villages, small towns, and aspirational dis-
tricts), disabilities (including learning disabilities), and socio-economic conditions (such as 
migrant communities, low income households, children in vulnerable situations, victims of or 
children of victims of trafficking, orphans including child beggars in urban areas, and the urban 
poor). Many among these groups who manage to continue their education struggle to achieve 
learning outcomes due to a lack of adequate support, nutrition, or access to learning resources. 
NEP 2020 also recognises the existing programmatic interventions that are in place, like provid-
ing scholarships, monetary incentives to parents to send children to school, and bicycles for stu-
dents who face issues with transport.  The extension of these mechanisms would be to practice 
inclusion and equity through everyday school process that would instill hope and bring change 
for those who continue to experience various forms of bias and discrimination. The experience 
of inclusion is critical to develop confidence and mutual cooperation among all students. Every 
504

child must experience a sense of belonging and togetherness with the others in their peer-group, 
where differences are embraced with respect and dignity.

 Inclusion in the School Physical 
 Environment 
Accessibility is not only the proximity of schools for all children, but access to all the essential 
facilities required for learning. This includes ramps and barrier-free passages inside the school 
for People with Disabilities, and Children with Special Needs (CWSN). The lack of proper toilet 
and sanitation facilities are one of the reasons for the drop in school attendance, especially 
among adolescent girls.   Schools must have well-maintained functional and safe toilets that are 
suitable for CWSN, separate toilets for boys and girls where the toilets for girls have a supply of 
menstrual hygiene products and dustbins for their safe and hygienic disposal. All common spac-
es and common property on the school campus that are meant for students and Teachers could 
be made accessible to all students and Teachers without discrimination. For example, furniture, 
stationery, plates used for meals, and glasses used for drinking water.
506
Part C
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Section 2.2 
 Inclusion Addressed through Curriculum  
 
 and Textbooks
Students learn best when they can connect their own lives and personal experiences with the 
content that is used in learning resources. This could be in terms of language and vocabulary 
used in the textbooks. As mentioned in NEP 2020, ‘UNESCO has declared 197 Indian languages 
as ‘endangered’. Various unscripted languages are particularly in danger of becoming extinct. 
When senior member(s) of a tribe or community that speak such languages pass away, these 
languages often perish with them; too often, no concerted actions or measures are taken to pre-
serve or record these rich languages/expressions of culture.’ Inclusion of various languages of 
the indigenous tribal minorities, as well as the languages and vocabularies that do not get used 
in the official and formal contexts of communication and dissemination, could be included in the 
school curriculum as these would be closer to the home languages and cultures that students are 
raised in. Similarly, examples used in textbooks, or in the content created by Teachers to support 
their classroom teaching could consciously include experiences from the lives of people and chil-
dren from SEDGs. NEP also recommends that curriculums should be free of all forms of bias and 
stereotypes and ‘more material will be included that is relevant and relatable to all communities.’ 
Students of all backgrounds would feel included and build confidence when the examples they 
read about are close to home, giving them a sense of belonging, familiarity/ ‘apnapan’ with the 
expressions and cultures that are being represented. 
Visual images have a powerful impact on young minds in shaping attitudes and behaviour. It is 
therefore extremely important that all backgrounds, genders, and abilities are represented in a 
manner that upholds their dignity and empowers them. Images of artworks created by well-
known artists from SEDGs to support content in different subjects could be one way of including 
their imaginations, expressions, and cultures. Images and illustrations that are custom designed 
for illustrating concepts and stories could focus on visualising the values, behaviours and equi-
table social constructs that are envisioned through the curriculum, e.g., depicting a picture of a 
playground where children of different backgrounds, abilities, and genders are playing together. 
507
Part C
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Section 2.3   
 Inclusion Addressed through Pedagogy
Efforts need to be initiated to recognise and address discrimination and bias that occurs in the 
classroom. One way of doing this is through seating arrangements. All students must get a chance 
to sit with and work with different peer-groups through-out the year. The reasons behind chil-
dren’s non-participation and involvement in the classroom could stem from not having friends, 
being bullied, or being treated unkindly by the peer-group. Teachers could be alert to check if any 
student is excluded from the rest in informal settings, during breaks, play, or meal times. Teach-
ers also need to ensure that children belonging to different genders, socio-economic groups, and 
with differential abilities interact with one another and develop meaningful bonds.
Discrimination and exclusion practiced by Teachers could take many forms. It starts with the 
belief that some students cannot learn because of their background, or ability and are labelled 
discriminatorily. Pre-service and in-service training programmes could address such issues and 
help teachers become aware of the biases and stereotypes that they may have, and how these are 
getting reinforced through their classroom practices. During classroom discussions, many chil-
dren get excluded when the Teacher focuses their attention primarily on those who are quicker 
to respond, or students who are more vocal. On the other hand, when a Teacher asks all children 
to first think about what they want to say and practice it in their mind before raising their hands 
or responding, it would give many others a chance to take their time to respond. In addition to 
this, a Teacher could also keep a track of how many student’s voices they have heard during the 
course of one lesson, or over a period of a week. This would give them insights into the students 
who are not able to participate actively or are having difficulty in expressing themselves and as 
a result, get excluded. Once a Teacher has this insight, they could work out strategies to encour-
age the quieter children to participate and share their views; and help them feel included.
Learning materials and resources used in the classroom could also be designed to cater to the 
needs of diverse learners, particularly CWSN, children with specific learning disabilities, and to 
suit multiple learning paces. Early identification and assessment of students who need special 
attention is a key factor in addressing inclusion. Children who exhibit difficulties with learning 
may require focused one-to-one attention or possess strengths that are not recognised. Teachers 
could take cognizance of the various reasons for the student’s difficulties and have a compas-
sionate approach while setting learning expectations or planning specific learning activities for 
them.  Similar approaches would apply to curricular areas like physical education where schools 
could have specially designed games and sports that have modified rules to allow the inclusion 
and equal participation of CWSN. In such cases, the modification could increase the challenge for 
those who don’t have disability by setting limits on their movements, rather than simplifying the 
game to accommodate those with disability. Such efforts would also develop empathy in the 
peer-group in understanding the challenges of disability through the game. Children of all gen-
ders could be encouraged to play sports together at all ages. There are several existing examples 
508
Part C
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
of schools where girls and boys in Middle and Secondary schools practice Kabaddi, kho-kho, and 
martial arts together. Such practices not only develop a sense of trust, comfort, sensitivity and 
confidence in all genders, it also strengthens the conviction to challenge prevailing biases in oth-
er spheres.
It is important for school teams to assess if their approaches and methods are being inclusive, 
and not merely assume that they are. This can be done by frequently making space for discus-
sions with students after the learning activities, for which the triggers could be like: 
a. Did everyone get a chance to participate in the activity? 
b. Did the teams/groups have representation of all genders that are present in the classroom? 
c. Did anyone experience any discomfort during the class/activity? 
d. Did anyone feel that they were treated unfairly during the class/activity? 
Such discussions can provide a space for all children to express the difficulties they experience 
and draw support from others. This also generates love, empathy, and care towards all.  
As with all school practices, inclusion and equity towards all needs to be a collective responsibil-
ity that is modelled by Teachers, Principal and all adult staff members, for students to observe 
and learn from.

Chapter 3 
Information and 
Communication Technology
Technology is a broad term used for all types of tools, methods, and processes created by human 
beings to improve their lives. In this Chapter the reference is specific to Information and Commu-
nication Technology (ICT). ICT includes a wide range of software and hardware tools and tech-
nologies including devices like computers and mobile phones, networks like the internet, and 
software applications. These technologies enable us to store, process, and access information in 
digital form. This information can be stored in both textual and audio-visual forms. These tech-
nologies have also enabled us to communicate this information with each other effectively, effi-
ciently, at scale, and at great distances. In the past few decades, ICT has transformed the way in 
which humanity engages with information. 
Since education is fundamentally about knowledge and information, and communication of that 
knowledge to the next generation, it is inevitable that ICT would play a significant role in educa-
tion in the coming years. The NEP 2020 recognizes this:
a. “Appropriate integration of technology into all levels of education - to support teacher prepa-
ration and development; improve teaching, learning and evaluation processes; enhance 
educational access to disadvantaged groups; and streamline educational planning, adminis-
tration and management.” [DNEP 2019, Chapter 19, Objective] 
b. “extensive use of technology in teaching and learning, removing language barriers, increasing 
access for Divyang students, and educational planning and management” [NEP 2020, Princi-
ples of this Policy, p.5]
c. “While education will play a critical role in this transformation (India’s transformation into a 
digitally empowered society and knowledge economy), technology itself will play an import-
ant role in the improvement of educational processes and outcomes; thus, the relationship 
between technology and education at all levels is bi- directional.” [NEP 2020, 23.1]
In this Chapter we will explore the potential of ICT in school education, the possibilities of use of 
ICT in school education, the precautions of use and abuse of ICT in schools, and finally the prin-
ciples of use of ICT in school contexts.

Section 3.1 
The Potential of ICT in School Education
It is hard to differentiate the hype that any new technology generates in being the silver bullet for 
mass school education from the reality of schooling. Every generation has heard this promise, 
whether radio or television, that introduction of this technology would radically improve school 
education. The outcomes have always been sobering. It is abundantly clear that any technology 
cannot fix fundamental problems of resource provision, teachers’ capacities and motivation, and 
students’ readiness for schooling. The centrality of the presence of a motivated and capable 
teacher in every classroom in achieving educational goals needs continued emphasis. Any imag-
ination of the use of technology in schools that is contradictory to this central principle needs to 
be abandoned at the earliest.
With this abundant caution, we will look at the potential of ICT in improving school education.      
3.1.1 Access
While textbooks have been a necessity for schooling on a large scale, it is also well understood 
that learning should not be limited to what is presented in textbooks. ICT has made it possible for 
both students and teachers to have access to a wide variety of content. With the spreading net-
work access to the internet and the ubiquity of digital devices that can connect to the internet, 
access to educationally valuable content has become more equitable and democratized.
3.1.1.1 
For Students: 
Direct access to digital content on the internet might not be appropriate for very young children. 
Access to digital content should be moderated and mediated by adults in this case. 
a. Students can be encouraged to access and engage with relevant digital material that 
supplements the content in their textbook. 
b. ICT can be used by students for additional practice and self-assessment.
c. Students can utilize technologies like peer forums and chatbots to clarify their doubts.
3.1.1.2 
For Teachers:
More than the students, it is for the teachers the use of ICT becomes significantly enabling and 
empowering. 
a. Teachers can use digital content available on the internet for supplementing the textbook 
material. Such content can enable different pedagogical approaches as well as provide 
different forms of engagement through audio-visual material. Textbook chapters, in the 
teachers’ handbooks, can embed appropriate QR-codes which guide them to relevant 
supplementary content.
b. Resources for suggested and illustrative lesson plans for specific content areas and textbook 
chapters aid the teachers in preparing for classroom instruction. 
512
Part C
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
c. Well-designed Pedagogical Content Knowledge packages for specific concepts can orient 
and prepare teachers conceptually for teaching.
d. Additional assessment tools and readily available worksheets can enable teachers to create 
formative assessments to understand the learning of the students.
e. More in-depth courses can allow teachers to deepen their perspectives of education as well 
as specific content areas. Teachers can enrol in these online courses and develop their 
capacities in their own pace and convenience. 
3.1.2 Content Creation
ICT has not only democratized access to content. It has also democratized the creation of con-
tent. ICT has the potential to enable a wide variety of practitioners to create educationally valu-
able and relevant content. 
a. Locally relevant content to be used in classrooms can be created with the assistance of ICT 
at the school cluster level by teachers and resource persons. 
b. Teachers can create content dynamically, based on the specific needs of their classroom. 
They can access existing digitally available content and modify it to their specific needs.
c. ICT has made it possible for content to be created and presented in various forms. Videos, 
audio clippings, graphic simulations, animated presentations, all these forms of content can 
now be easily created by a motivated and capable teacher with the use of simple tools in 
ICT. These different forms allow for a variety in the content used in the teaching-learning 
process.
d. ICT also enables students to express themselves beyond a simple textual form. They can 
capture their educationally relevant understanding in various audio-visual forms for the 
teachers to assess. 
e. With this NCF’s emphasis on Arts, Physical, and Vocational Education, it is not hard to 
imagine the central role played by digital content. Instructional videos would be far more 
effective than textbook chapters for these Curricular Areas. 
f. Generative AI technologies can be used by teachers to create content that is localised to 
their contexts and specific to their immediate pedagogical needs. 
3.1.3 Individual Attention
The fundamental tension in school education is that learning happens at the individual level and 
teaching happens, usually, at the collective level. While attempts at individualized pedagogy and 
assessments have been imagined, ICT has an important role in mediating the teaching-learning 
process to bridge this gap.
a. ICT can enable the recording and tracking of the learning achievements of the students at a 
fine level of granularity. This information can assist the teacher in creating useful learning 
profiles of their students. These learning profiles can help teachers in creating 
individualized learning plans.
b. Students can engage with personalized content through personal digital devices, moderated 
by the teacher in the classroom. ICT can assist in personalizing this content by using the 
students’ specific profile which includes their prior knowledge and tastes and preferences. 
513
Part C
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
c. In higher grades students can access digital content that explains the concepts in different 
languages and multi-media formats. Students can engage with these materials at their own 
pace. Thus, slowly shifting the responsibility of learning to the students and making them 
independent learners. 
d. Teachers too can receive individualized training plans based on their needs and 
performance. 
3.1.4 Interactive Content
The use of ICT allows for the possibility of dynamic and interactive content that a textbook can-
not manage. Such use of ICT might be appropriate from the Middle School Stage, where students 
engage with interactive content through digital devices. 
a. In curricular areas like science and mathematics, digital simulations can make engagement 
with concepts more hands-on and dynamic, thus improving conceptual understanding. 
b. With advanced voice recognition and natural language processing techniques, ICT can assist 
in oral language development through interactive software.  
c. Digital textbooks can have assessments embedded in them and students can check their 
understanding immediately.

Section 3.2 
Possible ICT Solutions for Education
The above section broadly outlines the potential of ICT to have a positive impact on school edu-
cation. To fully achieve the potential of ICT in enabling the vision of NEP 2020, the National Dig-
ital Education Architecture (NDEAR) was launched in July 2021. “The core idea of NDEAR is to 
facilitate achieving the goals laid out by NEP 2020, through a digital infrastructure for innovations 
by, through and in the education ecosystem.”
The NDEAR addresses the following aspects of ICT in education:
a. 2 Core Interactions – Learning Interactions and Administrative Interactions
b. 3 Scenarios – Learn, Help Learn, Manage Learn
c. 5 Key Personas – Student (any learner), Parent (any caregiver), Teacher (anyone who 
provides formal/informal teaching), Administration (anyone who can help manage), and 
Community Member (anyone from society including market players)
NDEAR attempts to enable a standardized and open solution for the above by creating:
a. Open Standards and Principles that define a set of:
i. 
Principles - e.g., technology and ecosystem
ii. Standards and Specifications - e.g. technology and data
iii. Guidelines - e.g., data process, ecosystem engagement
iv. Policies - e.g., data, openness, inclusion, accessibility
b. A Federated Architecture that identifies the key building blocks needed to make the 
architecture blueprint a reality.
c. An ecosystem of:
i. 
Actors to build, develop, innovate - interoperable building blocks
ii. Applications/Innovations in the form of Solutions, platforms, tools, and assets to be 
developed and used.
Digital resources for learning and for use by the five different personas have a very important 
role to play.
3.2.1 Digital Books and Libraries
Textbooks, stories, novels articles, and non-fiction in various languages in digital form are very 
important resources for school education.
3.2.1.1 
Relevance 
Digital books would be relevant across all subjects including vocational training. One example is 
to address the issue of low literacy levels requires more resources for the development of lan-
guage. Digital resources can aid in listening more, reading more, expanding vocabulary and 
515
Part C
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
meaning-making. The class and home need to be print rich, but it is also essential to be PRINT 
RICH DIGITALLY and have access to diverse digital content in the form of stories, books for vari-
ous levels of readers, audiobooks, read-along digital content, vocabulary builders, digital dictio-
naries, word games, video content, online courses to improve language in multiple languages 
and tools to get a sense of one’s own learning levels in language.
3.2.1.2 
Benefits of Digital Books
a. Overcomes physical barriers to access - Many books can be accessed by the individual even 
if they don’t have access to physical books in their local environment. 
b. Portable - They can be accessed from anywhere, anytime and across devices.
c. Extendable - Textbooks particularly can be extended, modified and updated quickly when in 
digital form.
d. Delays - Delivery delays can be overcome. 
e. Inclusive - Digital books lend themselves to accessibility, size of the font, page colour, adding 
read-aloud, and audiobooks can be enabled. 
3.2.1.3 
Resources
There are several platforms and resources available that enable access to digital books. Pratham 
Books Story weaver is a platform to access stories in various Indian languages and across differ-
ent reading levels. NCERT has made all its textbooks available online across various platforms 
SWAYAM, DIKSHA, and E-PATHSHALA among others. In addition, IIT-Kharagpur has the national 
digital library platform. Several private publishers are enabling access to digital versions of their 
publications be they fiction or non-fiction.
3.2.2 Videos, Animations and Audio
Digital material in the form of videos, animations and audio is useful to explain topics, and con-
cepts, and demonstrate through “how to …” for both students and teachers. 
3.2.2.1 
Relevance
Across all subjects and domains ranging from an explanation and demo video for teacher (and 
student) on “how to teach/learn place value using sticks and stone” to “watching a video of force 
in action in a cricket game”. Videos and animations are excellent learning aids for both students 
and teachers.  The creation of contextual content is as relevant as the consumption of content in 
the teaching and learning process. This form of digital content is particularly relevant for the 
curricular areas of arts, physical education, and vocational education.
3.2.2.2 
Benefits
a. Deepens understanding: helps understand the subject matter better by engaging multiple 
senses (seeing and hearing) of the learner and also enables visualisation of the topic or 
concept.
516
Part C
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
b. Connection: A video helps establish a human connection to the learning process unlike 
engaging only with text.
c. Shareable: the teacher can send a video to the parent via messaging and students can share 
with each other.
d. Independence: enables independent study by students and this becomes relevant as the 
learner evolves across stages. 
e. Repeatability and pacing: Videos also give the teacher the opportunity to demonstrate an 
aspect or subject repeatedly. The student can go back to ideas and concepts they have not 
understood and watch and learn again, it helps a student “personalise” their pace of 
learning.
f. Builds on an existing habit: engagement with videos across various platforms is an integral 
part of evolving learning habits, be it watching a cooking video to learn how to make an 
unfamiliar dish or a teacher watching a video on how to teach place value using sticks.
g. Makes interdisciplinary learning easier: A well-crafted video on the topic can connect 
domains of learning in a shorter and more efficient way. For e.g., connecting topics of 
physics demonstrated through playing cricket or cooking to chemistry or carpentry to math. 
3.2.2.3 
Resources
Videos and animations are possible across several platforms. Television and OTT platforms and 
radio including community radio can play a big role - imagine being able to watch a movie or 
listen to a play based on a story in the language textbook. 
Platforms such as SWAYAM and DIKSHA are regarded as well-curated spaces for curricu-
lum-linked content, in addition to several private platforms. Using the curation as well as sourc-
ing tools such as VidyaDaan available on these platforms, the quality of curriculum-linked con-
tent can be increased. The learning experiences from SWAYAM and DIKSHA can help evolve a 
body of knowledge of digital pedagogy which in turn can help craft a common set of guidelines 
that will enable the creation of better quality and relevant content. 
3.2.3 Online Courses
These are micro-courses and courses with certification available online. 
3.2.3.1 
Relevance
The national curriculum framework will open up the need for training and capacity building of 
teachers and administrators across the country. A cascade approach or only an in-person meth-
od of training will not be sufficient. The NCF also focuses on new curricular areas such as voca-
tional education and interdisciplinary areas. Neither students nor teachers should be limited by 
geographical barriers, language barriers or any other constraints in order to develop skills or 
explore interests outside of the school framework. Digital courses with or without credentials 
can enable exploration, skill and capability development. 
517
Part C
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
3.2.3.2 
Benefits
a. Anytime anywhere learning.
b. Choice of topics to learn and develop skills. 
c. Digital credentials for both students and teachers enable them to build and showcase their 
abilities and body of knowledge.
d. Opportunities to revisit and relearn.
e. Micro-courses as a concept will provide just-in-time bite-sized learning. Examples – for 
teachers,   “How to teach mathematics connecting to day-to-day living?”, “How to read aloud 
stories to make it engaging”, and “Tips on how to link sports and physics”. While for 
students on “How to make pots” “How to build a wooden table” “how to build a biogas 
plant”, “how to compost organic waste” “how to play a musical instrument” “How to develop 
the skills to be a sports person” “how to pursue a certain career e.g., police official” are 
useful educational resources. 
3.2.3.3 
Resources:
SWAYAM, DIKSHA, NISHATA platforms and several state training programs will be available for 
skill development and capacity building and issuance of verifiable credentials.
NCERTs and State SCERTs’ experience in rolling out large-scale online training programs are 
available to be leveraged to evolve the digital pedagogy that will work for the context, scale and 
constraints of India. 
Sourcing content by states or the centre for specific demands from the wider ecosystem through 
NDEAR Vidyadaan would enable the ecosystem to contribute.
3.2.4 QR Codes
3.2.4.1 
Relevance
Across all curricular areas access to a wide range of digital resources is needed. These resources 
could be in the form of further explanation content, demonstration videos, worksheets, courses, 
assessments, experience etc. QR code act as the access point to the wider resources starting from 
a familiar learning resource - either a textbook or any physical teaching and learning material. 
3.2.4.2 
Benefits
a. Bridging: Bridges the physical and digital teaching-learning environments. For e.g., in a 
multi-lingual classroom children whose home language is not the medium of instruction 
may need access to some basic translation of content in their home language.  QR-coded 
textbooks that connect the student to the explanation of key terms of each chapter in 
different languages, will help build vocabulary and better understanding. 
b. Extendibility: QR code on the physical books makes it possible to “extend content” 
supplement in a seamless way.
c. Connection: Due to the limitation of physical space on the materials it is easier to make 
connections in the digital space – interdependent and interdisciplinary materials either 
through text, audio or video can be made available to teachers and learners.
518
Part C
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
d. Inclusive: Across all subjects QR code enables access to diverse content relevant to different 
learners making inclusive classrooms a reality - audio added to books helps print-impaired 
learners and can be accessed through the QR code, similarly access to ISL content can be 
made available. 
3.2.4.3 
Resources
Digital infrastructure available in the form of NDEAR-compliant DIKSHA DIAL code and content 
repository enables the generation of taxonomy-linked QR codes to be used on teaching and 
learning materials. In addition content repositories such as DIKSHA or any other NDEAR-compli-
ant content repositories can be leveraged. 
3.2.5 Virtual Labs and Simulations
ICT allows for democratising access to environments for experiential learning, especially in sci-
ence and mathematics and makes scarce resources available for all through technology. 
3.2.5.1 
Relevance
Practical application of concepts and the ability to conduct experiments in a virtual environment 
will deepen learning in mathematics and the sciences. 
3.2.5.2 
Benefits
a. Access anytime anywhere: Students in remote locations get access to labs and enable 
anytime anywhere learning for all students.
b. Quality: Better quality of labs without being restricted to challenges of funding, 
procurement of materials and equipment.
c. Immersion: Visual aids to teach complex theoretical topics and concepts creates an 
immersive learning experience.
d. Safety: Ensures safety
e. Repeatability and flexibility: Time and space to repeat experiments and try new 
experiments without resource constraints.
f. Feedback loops: Faster feedback and learning loops where dependence on the teacher may 
be reduced. 
g. Equitable: As a shared common resource virtual labs as a common infrastructure provide 
equitable access to a scarce resource and remove constraints that apply to physical access. 
3.2.5.3 
Resources
The virtual labs project of the Ministry of Education has participation from many institutes of 
repute from higher education. However, more labs need to be created with a focus on the re-
quirements of school education, one such program is the Amrita virtual lab and can be accessed 
at https://vlab.amrita.edu/
519
Part C
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Leveraging open-source tools and adapting them to the Indian context such as for instance the 
PhET Interactive Simulations project at the University of Colorado Boulder creates free interac-
tive math and science simulations. These are based on extensive education research and engage 
students through an intuitive, game-like environment where students learn through exploration 
and discovery.
3.2.6 Content Creation Capabilities
ICT enables easy creation and sharing of educationally appropriate context for the local context.
3.2.6.1 
Relevance 
a. Across curricular areas, there is a need for the creation and distribution of contextual local 
content. Teachers and administrators are routinely creating and curating teaching and 
learning materials. This capability is demonstrated through the digital habit of teachers 
creating video content and sharing their work through messenger services. 
b. Ideas on how to create and generate local content should be made available to all DIETS and 
teachers across the country. The social science curricular area requires 20% of the content 
to be locally specific to that panchayat or district. Such content should be created and made 
available through NDEAR-compliant platforms such as DIKSHA.
c. Local content creation can be implemented as a decentralized process throughout the year 
and uploaded onto SWAYAM, DIKSHA and other platforms including local TV and radio and 
made available to all teachers.
d. Micro-courses that guide content creation processes should be made available to teachers 
and other content creators. 
e. The NDEAR ecosystem should enable community members to create relevant content, 
particularly in the areas of arts and vocational education.
3.2.6.2 
Benefits
a. Democratising content creation and building local capabilities will ensure contextual 
content development.
b. Self-sufficiency in resource regeneration at various levels will result in a diversity of 
teaching and learning resources 
c. Nuances such as addressing learning gaps and dealing with multi-lingual classrooms which 
are very specific can be addressed.
3.2.6.3 
Resources
a. There are various digital content creation tools across various platforms for various 
purposes, and there are various content platforms. For open and easy access, the NDEAR 
guidelines should be followed by content creators. 
b. DIKSHA provides the capability of multilingual content support and creation support at the 
local level.
c. NCERT guidelines for digital content creation and the creation of inclusive content are 
useful resources in this journey.

3.2.7 Assessments, Question Banks, and Practice Materials
Easy access to a portfolio of assessment tools, question banks and problem sets enables teachers 
to use them as appropriate in their classroom teaching.  
3.2.7.1 
Relevance
For achieving several competencies repeated practice becomes a necessity. At the same time, this 
practice work should not be routine and mechanical. To create a set of worksheets that allows for 
in-depth practice and at the same time sustain the learners’ interest is not an easy task. ICT can 
enable teachers to easily create appropriate practice tasks keeping in mind the learning levels of 
the students and their local context.
Teachers need question banks and problem sets linked to the curriculum to be able to do forma-
tive assessments of their students. Students can take charge of their own learning if assessments 
are non-threatening quizzes.
Assessments and quizzes can be done in many different ways - online at scale, online at a local 
level and in an offline manner. Question banks and practice questions levelled for different types 
and levels of learners will be required across subjects and languages. To also accommodate stu-
dent diversity assessments in many forms are to be facilitated e.g., paper-pencil tests, oral as-
sessments, project work, and group assignments.
3.2.7.2 
Benefits
a. Online assessments give teachers and administrators data instantly.
b. Teacher aide: Access to question banks to curate regular formative assessments will be a 
supportive teacher aide.
c. Student aide: Access to practice questions across levels and access to quizzes would be 
helpful to students to do independent practice.
d. Inclusion by levelling and enabling formats of assessments - curated levelling of questions 
in different languages and enabling various methods of assessment - oral, video and project 
work would allow the assessments to be within the zone of proximal development of the 
learners.
e. Digitisation of assessment responses can help determine gaps across regions and necessary 
remedial action to be taken. This needs to be done at the class and school level but is also 
necessary at scale if one needs to improve ASER or NAS. 
3.2.7.3 
Resources
Digital infrastructure may be leveraged to create question banks aligned to learning outcomes 
and curriculum goals. Tools for quiz creation can be leveraged from DIKSHA and also sourced 
from the ecosystem via NDEAR. NCERT has conducted several national-level quizzes on the DIK-
SHA platform for students, the same infrastructure can be used by teachers in a school or at the 
district level or at the state level.

Section 3.3 
Precautions in the use of ICT in 
School Education
3.3.1 Safety
Students in schools have not reached adult age. Safety is thus paramount in any decision related 
to technology use. While students can be physically protected within the boundaries of the 
school, allowing them to access the internet during school hours creates avoidable risks. It is the 
responsibility of the school to protect children from predatory and abusive behaviour often 
found on the internet. 
The effect of screen time and the use of digital devices on the well-being of young children is still 
not fully understood. This implies a cautious approach to the use of digital technology by stu-
dents at least till the end of the Preparatory Stage. 
3.3.2 Privacy
It is the responsibility of the school to protect the privacy of students when they are expected to 
use ICT for educational purposes. 
3.3.3 Inappropriateness
Controlling access to all content available on the internet is not an easy task. Even inadvertent 
access to inappropriate content can cause serious harm to young minds. Schools should be ex-
tremely mindful of this possibility and access to the internet should be under adult supervision 
in schools. For students in the Secondary Stage norms of behaviour in the digital world should be 
explicit as the norms of behaviour in the school.
3.3.4 Distraction
Several large-scale studies have shown that digital technology can be as much as a distraction as 
a useful tool for learning. Schools and teachers should be very cognisant of this possibility. It 
should not be forgotten that the purpose of the use of ICT is for the achievement of learning stan-
dards and not for the general entertainment of students or teachers.
3.3.5 Commercialization
In recent years rampant commercialization of educational content has resulted in very predato-
ry practices of commercial interests. These profit-seeking enterprises have preyed upon the anx-
ieties of parents and are promoting ICT-based educational solutions with doubtful efficacy. 
522
Part C
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Section 3.4 
Principles for use of ICT in School Education
ICT use should never be viewed as a replacement for classroom engagement. It should be seen 
only as a supplement to classroom interactions.
3.4.1 A Framework for Teachers and Education  
  
Administrators to Think of ICT in Education
Curriculum, syllabus, books and especially textbooks and other teaching and learning materials 
and resources are guides and tools for teachers and learners to create learning environments 
and navigate learning. Technology for learning and what it enables must be seen in the same way, 
as an enabler and a tool. It is really up to the user to make what they can and want to, the deci-
sion-making process is in the hands of the facilitators of learning namely teachers, administra-
tors and parents.  
One useful framework to consider when engaging with technology for learning is Substitu-
tion-Augmentation-Modification-Redefinition (SAMR) by Dr. Ruben Puentedura. Teachers have 
practices that they follow and are comfortable with. When a new idea or tool is introduced often 
the expectation is that the teacher will learn to use them and be effective. In reality, each person’s 
level of comfort is different and their ability to engage with new ideas and tools takes time and 
further, it takes some even more time to get effective results from a change in practice or use of a 
tool. 
The SAMR framework is not about how high-end the technology is or the sophisticated use of 
technology. 
There are two main functions of the SAMR framework. The first is enhancement where tradi-
tional learning is enriched by technology (which is achieved through substitution and augmen-
tation) and the second is transformation, where technology’s integration has fundamentally 
changed the process of learning (achieved through modification and redefining).
a. Substitution - when technology is used as a substitute for traditional practices thereby 
enhancing learning and adding value. Technology acts as a direct tool substitute with no 
functional change. For e.g a writing task is replaced by typing using a computer with MS 
Word or Google Docs.
b. Augmentation - when technology adds something to the learning process beyond just 
convenience. It enhances by doing something that was not previously possible. Extending 
the same example - typing on google docs where with one click the document is shared with 
others so comments and feedback can be given by others. 
c. Modification - when technology offers an opportunity the redesign of the task. The written 
document in the above example is posted online as a blog post for a wider audience to read 
and engage with. At this point it is not an essay, it becomes an article for a wider audience.
523

d. Redefinition - when technology allows for new tasks that were previously inconceivable. In 
this example of the writing, the document is written by collaborating with a wider audience 
and then published as collective work, this is then made in a video format and is shareable 
with an ever wider audience. The most sophisticated stage of SAMR, redefinition sees using 
technology to make entirely new learning opportunities possible. Redefining learning has 
the potential to connect learning with the real world and produce authentic outcomes. It 
also gives students strong technological soft skills such as digital collaboration, communica-
tion, technological literacy, and the ability to adapt to new systems and processes. It can 
also help create a more vibrant and engaged classroom.
3.4.1.1 
Examples of Enhancement through Substitution
a. Students type their work instead of handwriting it. The option to type instead of write has 
been an accommodation for students with learning disabilities. But more and more as 
students have started to do project work, producing printed materials is becoming accepted 
practice.
b. Students are able to participate in online quizzes and programs instead of in person and 
through pen and paper. NCERT has used DIKSHA to conduct national-level quizzes on 
several topics. Instead of in-person quizzes; This has enabled wider student participation 
from across the country, it allowed students from remote areas the same opportunities as 
participating in an in-person quiz which was only possible for those who could not travel.
c. Students have access to digital worksheets - Teacher sharing a worksheet digitally in PDF 
for student access, as opposed to printing, and photocopying. Sending worksheets, videos, 
and images on WhatsApp to parents is now becoming a common practice in India.
3.4.1.2 
Examples of Enhancement through Augmentation 
a. Students having a QR-coded book that links digital resources to a physical book augments 
access to a wider range of digital resources beyond what is locally available to the student. 
It will connect students and teachers which gives them access to a video explaining the 
same topic. A video explaining a complex topic in a simple way clarifies a particular hard-to-
explain concept. It might give students a clearer understanding of a complex topic or makes 
it engaging in a way that traditional methods can’t. Not all learners engage with the same 
teaching process in the most optimum way, different kinds of learners need to be stimulated 
differently and they learn differently. 
b. Students have access to audio and videos with subtitles - The QR code leads to an audio 
description of the topic, this would enable a learner with visual impairment to engage with 
the content. In addition to the explanations, there may be other related materials that the 
student could access.
c. Access to multilingual content - In India due to multilingual classrooms access to 
explanation content in the home language of the student would help deepen their 
understanding.
d. Access to practice content - Students can find practice and build mastery by doing more 
with access to content such as worksheets etc.
e. Tools to track the learning journey of self - Tools that help a student track their progress 
and see their learning away from the lens of a teacher or an adult. Linking this to the stages 
of learning of a student, technology can be used to augment the student’s journey towards 
524
Part C
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
independence. By using technology as a source of information, students can start actively 
learning without requiring constant teacher-led instruction. It allows for the introduction of 
more independent and student-centric learning.
f. Access to content - accessing digital materials where there are delays in access to or 
delivery of books and print materials. In addition, being able to manage resources due to 
lack of space or accessing resources promptly. 
3.4.1.3 
Examples of Transformation through Modification
a. Students produce a video or an audio recording summarizing a topic, which can then be 
accessed by other students as a revision resource.
b. Students create an informative video presentation in place of a standard oral presentation. 
They can use their voice alongside a broader variety of creative multimodal components.
c. Students use the virtual lab and conduct experiments and can share the same with the class, 
bringing to life a concept.
d. Student uses other tools such as digital manipulatives to understand abstract concepts in a 
hands-on, responsive way (e.g. voyaging on Google Earth to better understand 
measurement and geography).
e. Assessment is different - A traditional way to assess a student is to do a written paper for 
instance a write-up on a topic. A modified way to do this might be to ask for a presentation 
recorded on video or even an audio narrative based on the topic. 
3.4.1.4 
Examples of Transformation through Redefinition
a. Connect with the wider world - connecting your students with other people around the 
world as part of the learning journey.
b. Publishing work - having students publish their work online where it can be viewed by 
peers and the broader community.
c. Recording students as they deliver a presentation or practice a physical skill, then using this 
recording to prompt student reflection.
d. Experiment with tasks that use extensive multimodal elements (e.g. producing 
documentaries or short films, webpages, print documents with creative layouts).

Teachers may ask themselves the following questions as they determine the use of technolo-
gy in their classroom. Redefining the learning process does not need to be the goal. A few 
simple technological additions to an already effective teaching strategy might be needed to 
make a difference.
• What am I hoping to achieve by using this technology?
• How will it make a difference to my students’ learning?
• Why is it preferable to not use technology?
• How equipped am I and my students to use this technology?
• How much time do I have to invest in making it work?
3.4.2 Child Rights and ICT
The UN commission on the Rights of the Child adopted General Comment 25 on the digital rights 
of children in 2021 and issued the following guidance. There are four principles for children’s 
rights: 
a. Non-discrimination: Children must be protected from discrimination and treated fairly, 
whoever they are.
b. Survival and development: Children must be supported to grow up into what they want to 
be without harmful interference. In this context, the privacy and use of data of children 
must be handled with care.
c. Best interest of the child: When making any decision, adults — including governments and 
businesses — must do what is best for children rather than themselves. 
d. Respect for children’s views: Children have opinions that must be taken into account in all 
things they care about.
Based on the above principles, UNICEF has recommended specific rights for children in the con-
text of the use of ICT. These principles have been adopted by NDEAR too. 
526

Box C-3.4-ii 
UNICEF – Children’s Digital Rights
“In a digital world, where their actions and interactions could impact them into adult-
hood, the duty to protect children is that of governments, private organizations, and civil 
society.
v. Children have the right to privacy and the protection of their personal data.
vi. Children have the right to freedom of expression and access to information from a 
diversity of sources. 
vii. Children have the right not to be subjected to attacks on their reputations. 
viii. Children’s privacy and freedom of expression should be protected and respected in 
accordance with their evolving capacities. 
ix. Children have the right to access remedies for violations and abuses of their rights to 
privacy and free expression, and attacks on their reputation.”
India’s protection of personal data bill and laws related to the protection of children 
contain principles that must be applied in the digital context as well. Children have to be 
protected from tracking, tracing and in the context of education, labelling and discrimina-
tion.
Based on the above potential, possibilities, and precautions of ICT use in school educa-
tion, it is necessary to evolve a set of guiding principles for the use of ICT in school educa-
tion. 
3.4.3 Stage-Specific Guidelines for ICT Use
a. In all stages, students should not be exposed to any digital content that has commercial 
advertisements. 
b. In the Foundational Stage ICT use by students should be avoided. Students should engage 
with concrete material and real-life experiences. Engagement with ICT should be limited to 
specific audio-visual presentations made by teachers. Teachers can use ICT to create 
physical content like worksheets and other concrete materials but should avoid generating 
digital content for direct use by very young children.
c. In the Preparatory Stage ICT use by students should be restricted and limited to very 
specific needs. ICT use by students should be carefully supervised by teachers. Access to 
internet is perhaps not necessary. All digital content should be downloaded and made 
available offline. 
d. In the Middle Stage ICT use by students should continue to be under direct supervision of 
teachers. Digital content accessible over internet can be utilized but under supervision of 
teachers.
e. In the Secondary Stage, clear norms, and guidelines for use of ICT should be discussed with 
students. These norms should be given equal importance as to norms of behaviour in the 
classroom and school premises.

Guidance and Counselling in 
School
(To be edited) 
Children are unable to learn optimally when they are undernourished or unwell. Hence, the 
nutrition and health (including mental health) of children will be addressed, through healthy 
meals and the introduction of well-trained social workers, counsellors, and community involve-
ment into the schooling system”. [NEP 2020, 2.9]
...recognizing, identifying, and fostering the unique capabilities of each student, by sensitizing 
teachers as well as parents to promote each student’s holistic development in both academic and 
non-academic spheres” [NEP 2020, Principles of this Policy, p.5]
Efforts will be made to involve community and alumni in volunteer efforts for enhancing learning 
by providing at schools: one-on-one tutoring; the teaching of literacy and holding of extra help ses-
sions; teaching support and guidance for educators; career guidance and mentoring to students; 
etc. In this regard, the support of active and healthy senior citizens, school alumni and local com-
munity members will be suitably garnered. Databases of literate volunteers, retired scientists/gov-
ernment/semi government employees, alumni, and educators will be created for this purpose.” 
[NEP 2020, 3.7]
Guidance can be broadly defined as the process of assisting individuals to enable themselves. It 
is the process of a supportive engagement that enables a person to find direction, for making 
their own decisions and actions, towards personal well-being and useful social participation. 
Often, it involves a trustful relationship where the person guiding is in some position of trust-
worthiness, seniority, or authority, or is deemed insightful or knowledgeable. 
Counselling as a process involves an individual consulting another for advice. Much like the 
process of guidance, it involves helping individuals to understand and act upon their attitudes 
and decisions. Except that here, this change-seeking aspect takes a more central feature and of-
ten requires a skillful (and well-trained) individual to engage and challenge individual patterns 
of belief and behaviour.
In the school environment, Guidance and Counselling can be seen as paired words and not sepa-
rate activities. Here, it refers to the process of supporting the learning and maturation of stu-
dents and not as a stand-alone or a separate part of the school curriculum. It must be seen as 
complementary to the overall curriculum. Another important point to note is that the school 
curriculum is almost wholly designed for student groups. The pointed focus of Guidance and 
Counselling is on an individual student’s needs of learning, health, and well-being. 
Having a system of guidance and counselling would also help Teachers, parents, and administra-
528
Part C
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
tors to meet needs of different students e.g., difficulties in learning, career and higher education 
choices, maturation-related issues (adolescence, autonomy, social cohesion), mental health and 
well-being. 
529
Part C

Section 4.1 
Scope in Schools
In the context of schools, Guidance and Counselling can be seen as supporting the attainment of 
educational aims. It contributes to creating an ethos of overall well-being, teaching individuals 
an ethic of care and mutual respect. The scope of Guidance and Counselling support may be seen 
as follows:
a. Health and well-being for members of the school community: Providing basic Guidance 
and Counselling to students, parents, and administrators in the context of the school com-
munity in the following areas:
i. 
Physical health and wellness: This is one of the most crucial needs of growing up that 
requires careful addressing by schools. Designing programmes that contribute to good 
health and physical fitness for all students across the Stages in their school life is a 
central goal.    
ii. Psychological health and wellness: With a primary focus on students, Guidance and 
Counselling work must teach strategies for emotional regulation and positive 
motivation. While mild to moderate challenges with mental health challenges can 
receive counselling support within the school, it would be necessary to direct students 
and families to more qualified professionals outside the school system for clinical 
diagnosis and support.      
iii. Social participation and cohesion: This would involve teaching strategies for healthy 
adherence to social norms, expectations, and valuable social participation in the school. 
Schools would need to be equipped to meet the challenges of resistance, aggression, 
isolation, and bullying.  
iv. Cognitive health and growth: Identifying students who are struggling to meet 
cognitive developmental milestones, advising their parents with supportive strategies, 
and planning for additional teaching support.
v. Learning needs and diversity: Identifying challenges of attention and Specific 
Learning Disabilities, attending to challenges that arise from any form of physical 
disability in students, and creating Individualized Education Plans. 
b. Providing support for administrative and systemic improvements: Individuals in-
volved in Guidance and Counselling support must also be consulted while making decisions 
about the school’s functioning, policies, programmes, and activities. Enabling systemic 
improvements in schools that are cognizant of the diversity of learning needs primarily and 
other members’ needs for support.   
c. Academic and Career counselling: Helping students to make choices in the various Stages 
of their school life whenever newer curricular areas are introduced. Also helping with 
making decisions about academic and career choices after secondary school.  
530
Part C

Section 4.2 
Who Can Guide and Counsel
In formal and informal ways, School Teachers, Principals have always played the role and have 
long been naturally vested with the responsibility of guiding and counselling students and par-
ents. These members of the school are best placed (because of their daily contact and connec-
tion) to take up the responsibility too. 
Teachers, Principals, will be required to continue playing the role of guides and counsellors and 
should get basic education in this regard so they have the required skills and capacities. Howev-
er, it is an urgent need that a professional/specialist for Guidance and Counselling at least at the 
cluster level as suggested in NEP 2020 must be appointed as soon as possible. 
Also, considering the ground realities of a vast majority of schools across the country, it is im-
portant and reasonable to acknowledge that school systems will have their limitations in ad-
dressing many challenges that come up concerning Guidance and Counselling. A successful plan 
for such support would require an understanding of what kinds of challenges School Teachers, 
Principals can manage to address and what kinds of events or issues they cannot manage them-
selves but only direct to professionals outside the ambit of the school.
However, Schools that have the resources and access to professionals can simply take the lead 
and follow what NEP 2020 suggests.

Expected Outcomes  
A good quality Guidance and Counselling support process in schools over time will ensure the 
following outcomes are achieved at the level of individual students.
a. Students would be physically and mentally healthy as individuals and comfortably practice 
positive learning habits. 
b. Students would be retained in school and the number of school dropouts in all Stages of 
schooling is lowered significantly.
c. Students with diverse learning needs find equitable opportunities for support and growth. 
d. Individual students will be able to make good subject choices, vocational and career choices 
based on the advice they receive from Guidance and Counselling.  
e. Teachers and parents would be able to meaningfully communicate and support student 
learning. 
f. Administrative policies and practices would keep students’ achievement of knowledge, 
capacities, values and dispositions at the heart of all decision-making processes. 
g. The school environment would be experienced as safe and protected by all members of the 
school. 
h. The school environment is seen as a space that allows for creative expression.
i. The school year would look well-planned and designed with good-quality learning 
processes that demand rigour and discipline in students.
j. The school would receive adequate support and respect from the local community.

Developing Sensitivity to and 
Care for the Environment
(To be edited)
Certain subjects, skills, and capacities should be learned by all students to become good, successful, 
innovative, adaptable, and productive human beings in today’s rapidly changing world…these skills 
include: ... environmental awareness including water and resource conservation, sanitation and 
hygiene; ... [NEP 2020, 4.23]
The societal challenges that India needs to address today, such as access for all its citizens to clean 
drinking water and sanitation, quality education and healthcare, improved transportation, air 
quality, energy, and infrastructure, will require the implementation of approaches and solutions 
that are not only informed by top-notch science and technology but are also rooted in a deep under-
standing of the social sciences and humanities and the various socio-cultural and environmental 
dimensions of the nation. [NEP 2020, 17.4]
With climate change, increasing pollution, and depleting natural resources, there will be a sizeable 
shift in how we meet the world’s energy, water, food, and sanitation needs, ... resulting in the need 
for new skilled labour, particularly in biology, chemistry, physics, agriculture, climate science, and 
social science.” [NEP 2020, Introduction]
It is clearly understood that the world is at a crisis point due to environmental concerns. It is 
equally clear that encouraging students to build an understanding of the environment, develop 
sensitivity towards the environment and find ways to demonstrate care about their environment 
is a critical responsibility of school education. 
Developing sensitivity to and care for the environment is a central theme throughout the school 
education curriculum in this NCF.
Learning about the environment helps students discover it’s beauty and take pride, ownership 
and responsibility for its care. Students naturally observe and explore things and various pro-
cesses around them, and this will build on that natural ability and interest. This also helps to 
develops specific values e.g., dignity, appreciating diversity, respect for all living beings, respect 
for resources and their use, equitable distribution of available resources.
While it is important that students acquire a conceptual understanding of environmental issues 
and challenges, as well as an appreciation of the magnitude of the problem, it is equally import-
ant to ensure they do not get discouraged or despair for their future. To do this, the curriculum 
must focus presenting possibilities and positive examples of actions to contain or reverse envi-
ronmental damage. At the same time, it must be emphasized that the onus for mitigation is not 
534
Part C
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
only on individuals but on communities and nations as well.
India has a long history and rich traditions of environmentally sustainable practices. It is import-
ant for our students to understand this and learn about such practices from across different re-
gions of our country.   
535

Section 5.1 
Learning about the Environment across 
School Stages
Learning about the environment is an integral part of this NCF across all School Stages. This is 
reflected in different ways - as part of Learning Standards at every Stage (as reflected in Curric-
ular Goals and Competencies), as part of pedagogical processes across Stages, conceptually inte-
grated into curricular areas and as a separate curricular area.
a. At the Foundational Stage, Curricular Goals and Competencies are organised around the 
domains of development and not as curricular areas. Developing a positive regard for the 
environment, caring for all life forms and finding joy in engaging with nature is part of the 
Learning Standards at this Stage. Spending time in nature is an integral part of pedagogy at 
this Stage encouraging children to observe and interact sensitively with plants, animals, 
insects and birds.
b. At the Preparatory Stage, learning about the environment is integrated into World Around 
Us, one of the curricular areas at this Stage. The focus is to begin with the immediate 
environment of students and gradually broaden it by the end of the Stage. An inter-
disciplinary approach would enable learning and ensure that students do not receive a 
fragmented view of the world around. At this Stage, there are Learning Standards related to 
observing, understanding and engaging with nature. Pedagogical processes that emphasize 
caring for nature (e.g., growing plants, observing animals, using water carefully) are also the 
focus at this Stage. For students to become environmentally literate, they must learn by 
doing themselves.
c. At the Middle Stage, concepts related to the environment are integrated into Science and 
Social Science. This is to ensure that students engage with the basic ‘knowledge of the 
environment’ to enable deeper understanding of ideas around the environment at the next 
Stage. Learning Standards in Science and Social Science include those on understanding the 
environment (e.g., explores the living world around us, and its interaction with the 
inanimate world in scientific terms; Understands the spatial distribution of resources, their 
conservation and the interdependence between natural phenomena and human life). 
Pedagogical processes continue to emphasize sensitivity to and care for the environment. 
d. At the Secondary Stage, Environmental Education is part of Inter-Disciplinary Areas, a 
separate curricular area at this Stage. They will focus on developing a holistic 
understanding of key concerns and issues related to the environment drawing upon their 
understanding across other curricular areas. At this Stage, students can independently 
deepen their environmental knowledge, assess issues, and analyze their causes, make 
informed judgements on statements and debates in the media and in society, and use a 
range of techniques developed in earlier grades to investigate, analyze, synthesize, question, 
critique, and draw their own conclusions. They can use multiple perspectives to develop an 
536
Part C
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
integrated understanding, and advocate actions for certain environmental phenomena. 
Across Stages, students’ continuous engagement with and care of their environment is empha-
sized. Values related to the environment (e.g., collaboration, respect for diversity) have to be 
demonstrated by adults in the school so that students develop them as well. As students grow 
older, they must be encouraged to deepen their environmental knowledge, assess issues, show 
initiative, creativity, perseverance, and problem-solving skills for environmental action.

Rootedness in India
Instilling knowledge of India and its varied social, cultural, and technological needs, its inimitable 
artistic, language, and knowledge traditions, and its strong ethics in India’s young people is consid-
ered critical for purposes of national pride, self-confidence, self-knowledge, cooperation, and inte-
gration. [NEP 2020, Introduction, p. 4]
Knowledge of India will include knowledge from ancient India and its contributions to modern In-
dia and its successes and challenges, and a clear sense of India’s future aspirations with regard to 
education, health, environment, etc. These elements will be incorporated in an accurate and scien-
tific manner throughout the school curriculum wherever relevant. [NEP 2020, 4.27]
All curriculum and pedagogy, from the foundational stage onwards, will be redesigned to be strong-
ly rooted in the Indian and local context and ethos in terms of culture, traditions, heritage, customs, 
language, philosophy, geography, ancient and contemporary knowledge, societal and scientific 
needs, indigenous and traditional ways of learning etc. – in order to ensure that education is maxi-
mally relatable, relevant, interesting, and effective for our students. Stories, arts, games, sports, 
examples, problems, etc. will be chosen as much as possible to be rooted in the Indian and local 
geographic context. Ideas, abstractions, and creativity will indeed best flourish when learning is 
thus rooted. [NEP 2020, 4.29]
Our country is one of the most diverse nations on earth. We have a rich heritage and culture with 
varied traditions within and across local communities. Our country is also home to deep knowl-
edge in a variety of disciplines and fields from literature to mathematics, philosophy to arts, 
grammar to astronomy, ecology to medicine, architecture to agriculture, psychology to politics to 
education. Contemporary India is equally vibrant, taking its place in the modern world.     
The Indian vision of education has been broad and deep, including the idea that education must 
foster both inner and external development. Learning about the external world should be in 
consonance with learning about one’s inner reality and self. This is also an eminently practical 
perspective – developing good health and socio-emotional skills and developing the ability to 
think and make good and rational choices and decisions in the world, must occur in an integrated 
and holistic manner. Learning is not merely gathering information but is the development of self, 
of our relationships with others, being able to discriminate between different forms of knowl-
edge, and being able to fruitfully apply what is learnt for the benefit of the individual and of soci-
ety.
As promised in the NEP 2020, this NCF is strongly rooted in India’s context and in Indian thought.

Section 6.1 
How is this done across Stages and 
Curricular Areas? Some illustrations
Learning about India and situating learning in the child’s context, both local and national, is an 
integral part of this NCF across all School Stages. This is reflected in different ways - as part of 
Learning Standards at every Stage (as reflected in Curricular Goals and Competencies), as part of 
pedagogical processes across Stages, and as a fundamental principle of content selection through 
the Stages and across curricular areas.
a. At the Foundational Stage, the child’s own context is seen as the best source of learning 
across all domains of development.  Stories, music, arts, games, from the local context are 
part of content used for teaching. Learning the value of seva is one of the Curricular Goals at 
this Stage. Children are given the opportunity to read and learn from the original stories of 
the Panchatantra, Jataka, Hitopadesha, and other fun fables and inspiring tales from the 
Indian tradition. Stories from the lives of great Indian heroes of history are also seen as an 
excellent way to inspire and introduce core values in children.
b. At the Preparatory, Middle and Secondary Stages, each curricular area takes a particular 
approach to embed this based on the nature and expectations of each discipline.
i. 
Arts: The approach to Art Education in the NCF draws from ancient Indian texts like the 
Natyashastra, Abhinaya Darpanam, Shilpashastra, Vaastushastra, and Chitrasutra which 
have codified and structured the elements, methods, and aesthetic principles of the 
arts. Through different Stages, students will develop knowledge of these elements and 
principles and a vocabulary of the arts used to describe and discuss artworks and their 
processes. For example, sruti, naada, raaga, taala, laya, bhaava, alankaar, nritta, natya, 
pramaana, saahitya, gamak, meend, rasa.
It will help students understand the unparalleled diversity and multicultural ethos of 
Indian artistic traditions through a consistent and meaningful engagement with local 
arts, crafts, music, dance, theatre, puppetry, pottery, textile arts, basketry, and so on. It 
also ensures that students are exposed to different genres of classical, folk, tribal, 
popular, and contemporary styles by providing adequate opportunities to view and be 
inspired by various aesthetic sensibilities and apply their imagination and expression 
while making their own artwork.
The artistic processes of thinking, making and appreciation will but extend itself beyond 
the classroom to include the local community of artists and arts administrators, as well 
as a larger repository of art and culture through museums, archives, heritage sites, and 
other relevant cultural institutions and organizations. 
At the Preparatory Stage, students are expected to observe their local arts and cultures, 
and practice basic art forms like rangoli, clay work, pottery (without wheel), puppetry, 
folk songs, folk dances, and so on. At the Middle Stage, students are expected to learn 
simple artistic processes that are associated with different arts traditions and expand 
540
Part C
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
their knowledge of artists and art forms across their state and neighbouring states. They 
are also expected to draw comparisons regarding the stylistic features and social con-
texts of various arts practices of the region. At the Secondary Stage, students are expect-
ed to broaden their arts exposure to art traditions from different parts of India and ana-
lyze the similarities and differences, and the possible causes due to geographical or social 
contexts. They will also apply this knowledge into their own art practice as they refine 
their crafting techniques and ideation skills.
ii. Mathematics: India has long history of contribution to mathematics in various 
domains of the discipline. Indian mathematicians discovered the zero and used it as a 
place holder which led to the development of most unique and powerful numeration 
system in the world. Later, the zero was also established as a number by an Indian 
mathematician who defined the zero as the absence of something and gave the symbol 
for it like for other numbers. Other major contributions are the discovery of negative 
numbers and the rules for basic operation in negative numbers, property of right-
angled triangle that sum of the squares of perpendicular sides is equal to the square of 
the side opposite to the right angle and many more. 
Mathematics in this NCF makes a deliberate effort to introduce students to these major 
contributions in the field of mathematics by Indian mathematicians. At the Preparatory 
Stage, students will be introduced to major contributions made by Indian mathematician 
in numeration systems. Student at the Middle Stage will be able to understand the devel-
opment of important mathematical ideas over a period and locate the contribution of 
Indian mathematicians e.g., recognizes how concepts evolved over a period in different 
civilizations and the contributions of specific Indian mathematicians - Baudhayana, Pani-
ni, Pingala, Aryabhata, Brahmagupta, Virahanka, Bhaskara, Madhava, and Ramanujan. At 
the Secondary Stage, students will learn about contribution of Indian mathematicians to 
advanced mathematical ideas like algebra and coordinate geometry.
iii. Science: The focus is to discuss Indian contributions to scientific knowledge e.g., 
measurement systems and their role in regulating day-to-day lives, Indian calendar 
systems, contributions to astronomy, sound, material properties, metallurgy, chemical 
reactions, health and hygiene practices, traditional medicine systems and their basis, 
contribution made to space sciences, India’s space missions, motion of bodies, 
estimations at astronomical scales, and the world of atoms. The content will 
demonstrate the progress of Indian thought in a comparative chronology, the unique 
nature of Indian contributions, and their role in nation building.
At the Middle Stage, students will be introduced to Indian scientific ideas which can be 
explored through observation in the local community e.g., local ways of measurement, 
Indian calendar system, movement of celestial bodies. At the Secondary Stage, students 
will be introduced to contribution made by Indians on major scientific discoveries and 
ideas e.g., astronomy, medical practice, space research.
iv. Social Science: One of the key Curricular Goals is for students to appreciates the 
importance of being an Indian (Bhartiya) by understanding India’s glorious past and its 
rich diversity, geographical and cultural. Indian contributions to democratic ideas 
which flourished in ancient, medieval, and modern period are also an important part of 
student learning. 
541
Part C
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
At the Middle Stage, students will learn of the historical underpinnings which formed the 
modern Indian state and how idea of peace, ahimsa and co-existence have been part of 
Indian culture since ancient times.  At the Secondary Stage, students will go into details 
to understands India’s past and appreciate our rich diversity, culture, traditions, litera-
ture, philosophy, and knowledge systems.  
v. Language: Language education plays a crucial role to keep students rooted to their 
country, as it allows individuals to connect with their culture, heritage, and their place 
in the society. India is a country with a rich and diverse linguistic heritage, with over 
19,500 languages/dialects spoken across the country. Learning in the mother tongue or 
a familiar language till the Foundational stage will keep students connected to their 
cultural heritage. R1 which is most often the regional language will help students form 
a deeper understanding and connect. Exposure to other two languages (R2 and R3) 
help students to become multilingual, appreciate diversity and help form a national 
identity.   
This language curriculum will help individuals to connect with their cultural roots and 
heritage by providing them with a deeper understanding of the language, literature, and 
cultural practices of the country. It will help individuals to develop a sense of pride and 
belonging to their community and country. The Learning Standards reflect a rootedness 
in Indian culture and traditions across Stages. 
vi. Physical Education: Sports and physical activities are an inseparable part of our 
culture. It unites us together in one single emotion. India has very rich heritage of 
games/physical activity that developed across civilizations and centuries e.g., yoga, 
water sports, wrestling, malkhamb, archery, chariot racing, bullock racing, polo, 
different forms of martial arts, dance forms, dice games, hide and seek and innumerable 
number of other games/physical activities. 
The approach in Physical Education is to make these Indian games/physical activities an 
integral part of the curriculum across Stages. The chapter on Physical Education explicit-
ly outlines more than 50 local games to be used at the Preparatory Stage, recommends 
regular practice of yoga from the Middle Stage onwards to build breathing techniques, 
strength, flexibility, and endurance.

School Culture
School culture plays a significant and direct role in learning. It does so in two parts. First, it en-
ables an effective learning environment, by ensuring that children are free of fear, are engaged 
and excited, and encourages dispositions such as curiosity that are important for learning. Sec-
ond, it is one the biggest influences on the development of values and dispositions amongst stu-
dents, which are important curricular goals.  
Hence, school culture must be systematically shaped towards achieving the desired goals. NEP 
2020 states that “All participants in the school education system, including teachers, principals, 
administrators, counsellors, and students, will be sensitized to the requirements of all students, the 
notions of inclusion and equity, and the respect, dignity, and privacy of all persons. Such an educa-
tional culture will provide the best pathway to help students become empowered individuals who, 
in turn, will enable society to transform into one that is responsible towards its most vulnerable 
citizens (section 6.19)”.
The culture of the school also affects many other matters which in turn affect learning, such as 
the engagement and motivation of teachers and the involvement of community. These ‘indirect 
effects’ while important are not taken up in detail in this NCF.

Section 1.1 
 What is School Culture?
School culture can be understood in terms of values, norms, and beliefs or their manifestation in 
action in the form of relationships, behaviours, and practices. Students learn from the manifesta-
tions. It is these manifestations and thus the experience of the students that must systematically 
enable the curricular goals. It is therefore important for us to have clarity over these manifesta-
tions or the elements that constitute school culture. We see these constituent elements broadly 
in the following three categories: 
Relationships: This refers to how the school staff, students and the other stakeholders relate 
with each-other. For example, whether Teachers listen to students patiently and care about their 
physical and emotional well-being; do teachers collaborate with each-other for providing a more 
wholesome experience for students; does school welcome parents and ensures their participa-
tion in the learning process. 
Symbols: These are about various kinds of visual displays that we find in schools. For example, 
what is written on school walls and the pictures and paintings in the school corridor communi-
cate what is valued by the school. 
Arrangements and Practices: These are about arrangements – for example seating - and prac-
tices – for example, who participates in which sports – related to various classroom and school 
processes which signals the kind of culture the school stands for.
Unfortunately, many schools seem to pay little or no attention to this important aspect. Either 
they don’t see its value, or they don’t put in the necessary effort required. 
548

Section 1.2 
How does School Culture Effect Learning?  
School culture contributes to student learning in two ways: 
a. By creating safe, encouraging, and nurturing learning environment which is necessary for all  
 
kinds of learning engagements that are organized at school, and 
b. By directly contributing to attainment of curricular goals through development of desirable  
 
values and dispositions. 
1.2.1 Developing an Enabling Learning Environment
The learning environment at a school can be characterized either by constraint, compliance, and 
control, or it could be an atmosphere that instils trust, self-discipline, and inspiration to stretch 
one’s perceived limits and achieve one’s goals. An inclusive and nurturing culture forms the bed-
rock on which all school activities and pedagogical practices rest, grow, and succeed. Mutual re-
spect, a fear-free environment, and healthy relationships among students and teachers are es-
sential for having dialogue and collaboration. Without these, learning endeavours become a 
tedious task for everyone involved. Along with a fear-free environment, acting responsibly and 
showing rigour in studies are equally important characteristics of school environment that con-
tribute to achieving the necessary learning in each grade and stage of schooling.
These are key characteristics of such an enabling learning environment and some constituent 
elements of school culture that contribute to achieving them. We can see that these elements are 
relationships, symbols, or arrangements and practices.

humbly.
• Acknowledging and expressing gratitude for help received from 
others.
Caring
• Teachers check about students’ health, try to know how they 
feel, their interest areas, what makes them happy and the 
challenges they are facing.
• Teachers and students find ways of celebrating small achieve-
ments, progress made by students.
• Immediate help is provided when someone is not well, going 
through a difficult time.

peer groups, and student committees.
1.2.2 Development of Values and Dispositions
a. The need for systematic and deliberate effort
 
There are two major sources from where children derive their values and dispositions – our  
 
family/community and our schools. In both these spheres of their lives, the quality of  
 
relationships, symbols, and arrangements and practices (which we are calling constitutive  
 
elements of culture) are basically what determine what they imbibe from and how they  
 
behave in these spaces.  
 
The School Principal and Teachers tend to rigidly follow what they inherit in terms of the  
 
prevailing school culture and processes which is largely driven by School Principals’ or  
 
Teachers’ own values and dispositions. Principals tend to focus their energy on  
 
administrative compliances while most Teachers remain confined to syllabus completion  
 
work and consideration of value development remains unattended to. As an outcome,  
 
schools not only fail to develop desirable values and dispositions but may end up reinforcing  
 
various kinds of discriminatory social practices related to caste, gender, class, religion,  
 
region (migration, language), disabilities, physical appearance and skin colour, and  
 
perceived talent (smart versus weak student).  
 
It is absolutely clear and necessary that systematic, deliberate efforts are needed for  
 
development of values and dispositions which are comprehensive and done with all  
 
seriousness, very much like the efforts needed for teaching of subjects.

b. Values and dispositions as listed in NEP 2020
 
NEP 2020 gives us a comprehensive list of values that need to be fostered through schooling.  
 
These values are individually meaningful, and one cannot be subsumed in the other. But for  
 
curricular purposes, we can cluster ones that are more aligned and similar. The table below  
 
not only gives a list of these values and dispositions, in clusters, but also provides some  
 
constituent elements of school culture that will enable it.

Box D-1.2-i 
Challenges
Building a school culture that reflects the above-mentioned practices will have to face a 
lot of internal and external challenges. Internally, the challenge will come from the staff 
and students when their beliefs and behaviour imbibed through society may not be in 
alignment. Similarly, school practices may conflict with the prevailing cultural practices in 
the families and society. For example, which a school practices gender equity, there may 
be instances of gender discrimination at home. These conflicts must be seen as necessary 
part of establishing desired school culture so engagement with these conflicts in various 
forms would be required.  
553

Section 1.3 
Constituent Elements of School Culture
1.3.1 Relationships 
Relationships as one of the constituent components of school culture is basically about the dif-
ferent types of relationships that exist in a school, the essential expectations in those relation-
ships and how these expectations are fulfilled responsibly. At the core is ‘Teacher-student’ rela-
tionship. But the quality of student-student, Teacher-Principal, parents-Teacher/Principal 
relationships too have a bearing on student learning. 
The following are core characteristics of strong and inspiring relationships that a school needs 
to develop:
a. Mutual trust and respect
b. Openness, communication, and collaboration
c. Care 
d. Responsibility 
These core characteristics are seen in the context of school and learning. These are inter-related 
too and not water-tight categories. When you trust someone, you are open for sharing and col-
laborating. Similarly, a sense of responsibility naturally leads to caring for the other. 
1.3.1.1 
Mutual Trust and Respect
Trust and respect are fundamental to all relationships. Trust in this context refers to the basic 
belief in the human capability to learn, and the intent to exercise that capability to pursue goals 
that one assumes worthwhile. By respect, we mean recognizing and valuing an individual’s exis-
tence, views, identity, and their fundamental rights bestowed by the Indian constitution.  
In Teacher-student relationships, teachers openly show that they trust the capability of stu-
dents and that they can all learn; they respect every student’s pace of learning and make efforts 
to understand them as individuals from diverse backgrounds. Teachers help students feel a con-
nect with the whole school community and at the same time build an identity and space for 
themselves; listen to them patiently and care about their physical and emotional well-being. Stu-
dents feel respected when teachers give them time and space to share their feelings, views, and 
work. 
For enriching student-student relationships, conscious efforts are necessary to give them op-
portunities to mingle and work collaboratively with peers hailing from different socio-cultur-
al-economic backgrounds, different age groups, genders, and abilities. From a young age, stu-
dents can be encouraged to speak politely, pay attention to one another, and demonstrate care 
and helpfulness at any given opportunity. 
In India, Teachers need to be reinstated to the respect and status they once enjoyed as Gurus. In 
Teacher-Principal/administration relationship, trust and respect is critical for sustaining 
motivation, energy, commitment, and collaboration. It is done by providing good working condi-
554
Part D
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
tions i.e., having formal and informal ways of listening to teachers’ views and experiences, inclu-
sion in decision making, giving space to exercise their professional expertise within the larger 
policy guidelines and by appreciating their hard work. Another kind of relationship is the Teach-
er-Teacher relationship. It is important that all Teachers from diverse backgrounds, genders, 
age-groups, and experience get respect and support from other teachers. Teachers too need to be 
provided spaces and opportunities to learn from each other and to work collaboratively. Apart 
from academic sharing, Teachers also need to relax and rejuvenate so this could be purposively 
planned, be it engaging in sports and cultural activities or having some celebrations or excursion 
trips.
Schools need to build trust and respect in its relationship with parents. Parents need to feel 
comfortable in approaching School Principal and Teachers. When school reaches out to them, 
welcomes them, gives them regular updates, and consults them on relevant matters, and tries to 
use their knowledge and expertise, they feel respected.   
1.3.1.2 
Openness, Communication, and Collaboration 
Openness, communication, and collaboration are characteristics of healthy relationships. When 
there is trust and respect in any relationship, people open-up, share and listen to each-other 
empathetically and are more than ready to engage in collective tasks because they derive plea-
sure and strength through that companionship. Here are a few ways how schools can work on 
this front: 
a. There should be spaces for open sharing like circle time in classes, daily diary sharing in  
 
school assembly as well as encouragement for reaching out to Teachers and School Principal  
 
for frank sharing. 
b. A lot of opportunities to be created for working together for Teachers and students. This  
 
helps them test as well as strengthen mutual trust and respect for each other. This will also  
 
help them to reflect on their own conditioning and to build inter-personal skills.  
c. Art, music, drama, sports naturally provide such opportunities where we need to work in  
 
groups; so, finding space for these subjects in school timetable is necessary. Such time is also  
 
required for Teachers.  
d. It is expected that when there is greater openness, greater communication and working  
 
together, there will be differences and conflicts; but they should be seen as opportunities for  
 
finding solutions collectively. Some differences may get resolved, some may take longer time,  
 
and some may never get resolved but that should not dampen the spirits and become an  
 
impediment for working collaboratively at tasks that matter for the advancement of the  
 
school. 
All collaboration must be channelized for the ‘pursuit for excellence’. Students should be en-
couraged to set high expectations for themselves and support from others along with hard work 
should help them achieve their goals. 
Relationships get tested when faced with a situation where classmates or schoolmates are com-
peting against each other in a competition, be it a sport event or some other type of competition 
like debates, essay writing, Olympiads for Maths and Science etc. On one hand, the culture should 
help one to strive hard to excel in one’s skills and at the same time, one should learn sportsman-
555
Part D
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
ship and how to deal with both success and failure. One can compete without compromising 
values of cooperation, empathy, resilience, appreciation of effort and excellence. The feeling of 
‘Mudita’ (the feeling of rejoicing in the achievement or success of others) can also be developed.
1.3.1.3 
Care
Care is an essential expression of nurturing relationships when one feels related and responsible 
to the other. In normal circumstances, caring would mean acknowledging the presence of others 
by simple ways like smiling, greeting, handshaking and giving others space in physical terms (for 
sitting, during movement) as well as for voicing one’s views and suggestions. When we care for 
others, we make efforts to know them better and which, in turn, helps us understand them as 
individuals with their strengths and weaknesses and likes and dislikes and what all they have 
been through in life. All this is important information that helps while living and working 
together. 
The need for caring is truly felt in difficult times i.e., when one is unwell, facing some challenges 
at personal or family front or going through negative, undesirable emotions for some reason. 
This is when others need to extend support in ways which gives strength and helps the person 
come out of that situation.  
Care is what people remember – both timely expression of it as well as not having it when it was 
needed. This goes a long way in nurturing relationships. 
In the context of schooling, it must be seen in the context of the overall objective i.e., learning. So, 
caring would also mean expressing concerns politely and drawing attention of relevant people 
on issues which are affecting learning negatively.   
1.3.1.4 
Responsibility
Any relationship will not sustain if the related parties don’t act responsibly. In the context of 
school-based relationships, acting and behaving responsibly means – following the agreed rules 
and regulations of the school; not to behave and act in ways that hurts others; and to work to-
wards completing one’s tasks for achieving one’s goals. This is applicable to all who are part of 
the school community. Specifically speaking, students, the general expectations would be like – 
paying attention and following instructions, asking questions, expressing one’s thoughts and 
doubts, working in groups, peer support, consistency in practice, and applying what one has 
learnt in real life situations, etc. This is what acting responsibly would mean for students in stu-
dent-Teacher relationship. Similarly, for Teachers, the expectations would be like – making ef-
forts to know individual students and what they already know, making them comfortable and 
listening to them, planning, finding effective and engaging ways of teaching, giving appropriate 
challenges and handholding support, and assessing progress of learning to make necessary 
changes in teaching, etc. 
Anything that is detrimental to the process of learning; anything that disturbs or disrupts the 
process is to be avoided. 
556
Part D
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
1.3.2 Symbols
Schools try to communicate a lot through use of symbols. A symbol is any form of visual sign – 
writing on the wall, paintings, idols, arrangement of physical objects that convey what the school 
is valuing. In some public schools, one comes across this phrase ‘Shiksharth aaiye, Sewarth Jaiye 
(come to learn, go to serve)’ right at the entry gate. This is a daily reminder to students about 
why they are coming to school and what they are expected to do with their learning.  Here are a 
few more symbolic displays that we generally come across in schools:
a. Schools may also use huge hoardings and display boards for public to emphasize what they  
 
feel valuable about the school. It could be pictures of students who secured top ranks in  
 
Board exams or different facilities the school provides. It could be about having smart  
 
classes or providing coaching in different sports.  
b. There are lots of ‘sayings’ or ‘quotes’ written on school walls. 
c. One may also find pictures of important and famous people and even idols representing  
 
certain religion either in Principals’ room, staff room, classrooms or in school corridor.
d. The choices and arrangement of physical objects also carries huge symbolic value.  
 
Principals’ chair would look very different than chairs for the staff. A school may choose not  
 
to provide chairs for Teachers in classrooms so that they must remain standing and in  
 
moving condition. The arrangement of furniture in classrooms also communicates school’s  
 
beliefs on teaching-learning processes.
e. Some schools paint entire walls with some pictures while others may use display boards  
 
where student work is presented. 
Schools need to consciously and carefully decide how to effectively use the power of symbols. It 
must be in alignment with values that schools are fostering so inclusive in terms of giving space 
to all kinds of good ideas, good work and allowing all students to contribute and learn from them. 
Here are some good practices in this regard:
a. Instead of having permanent ‘sayings’ or ‘quotes’ on the walls, a better way would be to have  
 
a dedicated space for ‘thought of the day’ and students can take responsibility of that. It  
 
could just be a small while board and students can take turns to write the thought there.  
 
This would be an inclusive practice as thoughts coming from not only the established  
 
national heroes but also the lesser-known individuals belonging to different communities  
 
can also be given space and recognition. 
b. There could also be dedicated spaces for representing the local, regional, and national  
 
cultural heritage. Here again, refraining from having permanent displays will help student  
 
learning. These could be group project works and the display can remain there for a month.  
 
All students can be expected to read it and there could be a quiz or sharing session in the  
 
school assembly based on that display. 
c. School corridor passage can have display boards where each class can display what they are  
 
learning so any visitor will get a good sense of classroom work just by taking a walk around  
 
the school. Selection of student work for display will be crucial and one need not select the  
 
‘perfect’ looking or more visually appealing work. Work done by all students showing varied  
 
levels of capacity is far better as it will create ownership among students and whoever has a  
 
look will get a good sense of class progress. 
557
Part D
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
d. Schools may also name some rooms/halls, even classes or buildings with some renowned  
 
personalities, rivers etc. There may be names given to student houses in larger schools.  
 
These should also reflect the diversity of our country.
e. School uniform also has symbolic value. The colour as well as the kind of dress chosen  
 
communicates to the world the belief of the school. One may opt for more traditional,  
 
modern or gender-neutral dress. Consideration of local climate, safety, easy availability, cost  
 
effectiveness will reflect school’s sensitivity. 
f. There could be a permanent kind of notice board in each school where some school related  
 
information for visitors and some important phone numbers (for example. child help line,  
 
hospital, school helpdesk) and key behavioural expectations from all on campus can be  
 
displayed.   
g. Sometimes, schools practice symbolic representation of hierarchy. For example, there may  
 
be a different set of cup/mug in which Principal is served tea. Such practices need to be  
 
avoided as they go against the values a school is fostering. 
1.3.3 Arrangements and Practices
All schools function with the help of certain classroom and school level processes. Each school 
process requires some arrangements and practices. For example, mid-day-meal is an important 
daily process in public elementary schools. To run mid-day-meal smoothly, some arrangement 
about procurement, cooking and serving are there. There will be practices around menu prepa-
ration, quality check, food serving and proper utilization of food waste. The nature of these ar-
rangement and practices reflects and foster the beliefs and values of a school as well as of the 
education system. 
In this section, we look at the arrangements and practices around major school processes – class-
room processes, school assembly, mealtime, sports activities, engagement with parents and 
community. There are other processes too, but these are the key processes found in all schools. 
The school processes are dealt with more exhaustively – beyond the arrangements and practices 
which constitute school culture – in the subsequent chapter.
1.3.3.1 
Classroom Practices
We need to understand how different classroom practices promote certain values. 
Seating Arrangement: If all children always sit facing the board, such an arrangement conveys 
a perception that the primary sources of learning is the blackboard and the Teacher. While a cir-
cular, semi-circle or group seating arrangement allows students different learning experiences 
as they can interact with their peers and work collaboratively. If there is a practice of presumably 
smarter students occupying front seats and those who are lagging sit at the back, then this prac-
tice itself will reinforce who learns and who doesn’t. Separate seating for boys and girls; students 
sitting on floor mats and teacher on the chair are ways that establish differences and hierarchies 
rather than breaking them. 
558
Part D
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Availability and accessibility of teaching-learning material: A classroom can be full of learn-
ing material – on walls, in the open racks and almirah or without it. Accessibility and uses is an-
other issue. When there is sufficient and relevant material and students can make use it, then 
students can be engaged at different levels, and it brings more vibrancy in the learning process. 
Having a ‘reading corner’ with a collection of books that are suitable for the learning levels and 
age-groups of the students would encourage a culture of reading. Such practices clearly shows 
that the school’s commitment towards ensuring learning for all.
Giving ownership and responsibility to students in the learning process: There could be a 
classroom culture where students are totally dependent on Teacher instructions and reluctant to 
take self-initiative. On the other hand, student can actively take charge of their learning process. 
They can be involved in preparing teaching-learning materials, displaying it on the walls, main-
taining their own progress portfolio file, leading peer learning sessions and can even be asked to 
do short teaching sessions in the guidance of teachers.
Swachchta (Cleanliness): Cleanliness and tidiness of the classroom can be the responsibility of 
students. Before closing the day, the classroom can be cleaned and made tidy again for the next 
day.
There can be certain rituals that are followed during classroom processes. Different teachers 
may initiate and sustain different rituals that is why classes of different teachers could be very 
different cultural experiences. One may make the whole atmosphere relaxed but focused while 
another teacher may make it tense and intimidating. For example, there are teachers who start 
by having some informal chat and listening to what students would like to share before moving 
on to their teaching plan while another teacher may just expect all those who couldn’t do their 
homework to stand up and give an explanation. Movements, speaking, interactions, praise or 
scolding, expressing happiness and concern all may take forms which either prove detrimental 
or add richness and joy to the learning process. 
1.3.3.2 
School Assembly
A lot can be achieved through school assembly if this space is utilized properly. Different groups 
of students can take lead in organizing it under guidance from teachers. It could be a forum 
where not only the home language but the whole range of language diversity of India can be giv-
en importance. Students can be encouraged to give presentations, sing songs, perform skits in 
several languages. Even if students learn to sing one song of the other parts of India, they feel 
some familiarity and connectedness. If there is enough space available, the whole group could 
dance on music selected from different parts of India.
On important days, Teachers and students can talk about different people or events that make 
that day memorable. Real stories of courage and resilience, nishkaam karma and sewa can be 
narrated. Opportunities for sharing what students are learning in various subjects, through li-
brary or from home should be created. One day, a quiz can be done based on the school corridor 
displays if these displays are changed regularly. Skits can be performed on various social issues 
to sensitize students and sometime could regularly be devoted to discussing current issues faced 
by our society and nation.

Part D
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Duration of the assembly, seating arrangement, anchoring responsibility, proper communication 
on what would be done on each day, use of musical instruments, sound system and preparation 
for assembly etc. all needs to be paid close attention from cultural perspective. For example, it 
would be difficult to have the whole assembly standing. Asking students to sit in class-wise lines 
may not be needed as mingling with other students can be allowed. Even younger students can 
shoulder anchoring responsibility with seniors.
1.3.3.3 
Mealtime
Mealtime is an important time so food quality and serving practices both are important in deriv-
ing satisfaction from it. Students from various socio-cultural backgrounds should sit and enjoy 
the meal together. For many students this could be one proper meal that they get during the day, 
so it is important that schools pay required attention. Teachers need to check the quality as well 
as participate in serving it or eating it alongside students. They can observe students eating hab-
its and have a dialogue with them afterward. Good hygiene standards need to be maintained and 
groups of students and Teachers can take up this responsibility. 
1.3.3.4 
Sports Activities
Making room for sports activities in daily or weekly timetable in which the whole school partic-
ipates is important. The setting of a playground, the group dynamics during sports is usually 
very different than a classroom. Different students may be more skilled, and they can even guide 
teachers on how to play a particular sport. Schools must not let go of the opportunity a play-
ground offers for building student-student and student-Teacher relationship and in teaching co-
operation, teamwork, courage, resilience etc. Students of all genders should be encouraged to 
play all the sports. There could be specially designed games or modified rules of regular games 
to allow the inclusion and equal participation of students with disabilities. Students can be mo-
tivated to try hard to improve their own skills and timings so a comparison with their own pre-
vious performance. Students can fix their own goals and teachers can also guide them to set next 
level of challenges. 
1.3.3.5 
Engaging with Pare nts and Community
Culture of a school easily reflects in the way it welcomes and engages with parents, community, 
and other visitors. Irrespective of the parental backgrounds, attitude and dispositions, schools 
need to make them comfortable. There should be clear communication with parents on when 
they can visit schools. They should be properly welcomed and attended to. Parents want to know 
‘what are their children learning’ so the sharing from Teachers’ side cannot be just about the 
challenges and struggles. The reception area or the school premises should have displays that 
reflect the kind of work happening in the school. There could be some activities and games de-
signed for active engagement of parents. They can also be invited to share their experience and 
knowledge with students in a planned way. Regular home visits by Teachers would go a long way 
in building this parent-teacher relationship. 
School need not limit itself to parents only. The larger community from where students come 
need to be engaged through annual day and other school functions and by school’s participation 
in local events.

Box D-1.3-i 
Inclusion and Participation
Inclusion and participation of all needs to be the core consideration across the elements 
of school culture. Otherwise only a few benefits from the opportunities available in school 
processes and majority may feel isolated or even discriminated. School processes have 
the potential to help every student and staff member experience a sense of belonging and 
togetherness with the others. Teachers must notice if any student is being or feeling 
excluded from the rest not only in classroom but also in informal settings, during breaks, 
play, or mealtimes. Teachers also need to ensure that students belonging to different 
genders, socio-economic groups, and with differential abilities interact with one another 
and develop meaningful bonds.
Discrimination and exclusion practised by teachers could take many forms. It starts with 
the belief that some students cannot learn because of their background, or ability and are 
labelled discriminatorily. There need to be processes that help Teachers become aware of 
their own biases and stereotypes, and how these get reinforced in their classroom prac-
tices. 
It is important for school teams to assess if their approaches and methods are being 
inclusive, and not merely assume that they are. This can be done by frequently making 
space for discussions with students after the learning activities where students can be 
asked to express how they felt while participating – if they felt comfortable and experi-
enced fairness. Such discussions can provide a space for all children to express the 
difficulties they experience and draw support from others. This also generates love, 
empathy, and care towards all.

Chapter 2 
 School Processes 
Every school has certain processes in place to ensure two things – the smooth functioning of day-
to-day activities and enabling the school to progress towards achievement of curricular goals. 
For example, schools must decide how they are going to make use of the available time on day-
to-day basis as well as over the year. Therefore, the need of a yearly calendar as well as a daily 
timetable along with a process that helps in generating and incorporating changes in these in-
struments of time allocation. 
All kinds of tasks, whether seemingly simpler ones like attending to visitors or ensuring cleanli-
ness of school premises or the more complex ones like monitoring and improving the quality of 
teaching-learning and responding to disciplinary issues need to have well thought out processes. 
Processes should clarify what needs to be done, the process of decision making, and the spirit 
with which one must act and respond. 
Another important aspect of school processes is that they reflect the values and beliefs of a 
school and in turn reinforce them. The previous chapter discussed this.
562
Part D
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
School processes can be seen in the following broad categories:
a. Curricular Processes: These are processes that have direct effect on learning. For example,  
 
the school timetable, school assembly, library, student committees, celebrations and events,  
 
use of technology. 
b. Curricular Associate Processes: These are processes that have significant but mediating  
 
effect on learning. For example, processes for Teacher Professional Development,  
 
engagement with parents and community, MDM etc.
c. Organisational Processes: These are processes that enable the visualization and smooth  
 
functioning of the above two processes. For example, school development plan, annual  
 
calendar, mobilizing and allocating resources, data management and reporting, resolution of  
 
conflicts and disciplinary issues, safety related issues.
563
Part D
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Section 2.1 
 Curricular Processes
These are processes that have direct effect on learning. For schools, an important question is to 
make best use of the time and resources available for student learning. Within this, there are two 
considerations - how to allocate time for learning of various subjects and how to create learning 
spaces beyond subject classrooms, such as school assembly, library etc. This section talks about 
how effective use of daily time and spaces and opportunities beyond subject classrooms could be 
made for learning. Subject teaching processes are covered in chapters dealing with specific sub-
jects.  
2.1.1 School Timetable
A timetable provides structure to the daily routines and activities carried out in the school. It 
must be decided very imaginatively so that it allows for different engagements without compro-
mising the requisite time for different curricular subjects and whole/mixed group activities. A 
good timetable allocates time as per the weightage given to different curricular areas and pro-
vides scope for incorporating multiple activities (many of them may be weekly/fortnightly or 
monthly) without disturbing the larger structure too much. For example:
a. School assembly, last period of the day, and Saturdays could be seen serving multiple  
 
purposes. On alternate days, in place of school assembly, a common sports/activity period  
 
for the entire school can be imagined. Similarly, last period of the day could be dedicated for  
 
club activities (music, theatre, art, literature, sports etc.) where students can participate or  
 
even lead various creative engagements. This slot can be used for preparing for various  
 
events too without disturbing the flow and consistency which is required for learning  
 
improvement.
b. The idea of a block period for allowing extra time to certain topics would be ideal. For  
 
example, lab activity or project work require more time. So, teachers can mutually plan for  
 
utilizing block periods as necessary. 
c. Saturdays can provide greater flexibility and scope for doing a variety of engagements such  
 
as short field trips, interaction with local community, dialogue around adolescent issues etc.
There shouldn’t be too many changes in the daily timetable as it disturbs the rhythm of the 
school. It should be thought-out stage-wise keeping the demand for each stage in mind. Depend-
ing upon the time of the year, such as admissions, exams, festivals, there could be pre-planned 
variations to best utilize that period.
2.1.2 School Assembly
Assemblies bring the whole school community together and facilitate collective learning and 
appreciation that goes beyond the confines of subject domains. School assembly is an ideal way 
to start or end the day with positive vibes. Instead of making assemblies ritualistic and mechan-
ical exercises, schools should think of innovative ways to make assemblies meaningful. A variety 
564
Part D
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
of arrangements can be explored, and the sequence and format of presentations could change 
from one day to the next so that all students get opportunities to participate, interact, present, 
and respond to the events. Schools must ensure that the assembly does not impose any pressure 
to perform, or deliver ‘perfect presentations’, and instead should be seen as a process of sharing 
and learning, accepting flaws, and getting over stage fear by creating a setting that makes all 
students feel comfortable where no one is judged, insulted, or ridiculed. 
Assembly in the Foundational Stage can be mostly held in the classroom with a weekly gathering 
of two or more grades in larger groups. From the Preparatory Stage, students could participate 
in multi-grade and whole-school assemblies. 
Assemblies are generally done at the start of the day and depending upon the school size, it could 
be one or many small group assemblies happening simultaneously. A minimum of thirty minutes 
is needed to have some meaningful engagement. For larger weekly assemblies, more time can be 
provided. Presentations could include singing the national anthem and a variety of songs in dif-
ferent languages, a few minutes of meditation or quiet time, storytelling, skits, mime, reporting 
local news based on students’ research and interactions with the local community, book/movie 
review, presentation of artwork, magic tricks, puppetry, sharing relevant instructions or infor-
mation related to other school processes and school administration. Singing songs can involve 
the audience where they repeat the lines after the presenters, or they can all sing together if it is 
a commonly known song. Similarly, some physical activities, dance and movement can be per-
formed by the whole group if there is sufficient space. Schools could also plan activities based on 
certain themes so that students can explore ideas and expressions in a variety of modes. All ac-
tivities must aim to actively engage the audience and invite their responses.
Efforts must be made to ensure that all students get an opportunity to present at the assembly 
either individually or as a part of a group so that they gradually develop the confidence to ex-
press themselves openly and present their ideas to larger audiences. 
2.1.3 Library
The role of books in formal education is central and starts even before one has gained literacy 
skills. Library opens up the scope for self-driven and guided acquisition of knowledge beyond 
textbooks by having access to a variety of good books and other digital resources from around 
the world. Therefore, a rich library in a school and a library corner in each classroom is a neces-
sity. 
A library could be housed in a dedicated room/hall or can be there in each classroom, but the 
critical point is ‘availability’ of relevant books in good numbers and an easy ‘accessibility’ mech-
anism. Efforts must be made to include content that represents various genres, India’s rich heri-
tage and the lives and imaginations of people from various regions and diverse backgrounds, 
including those who belong to the socio-economically disadvantaged groups. Bilingual books 
and some books in other Indian languages would be good in the library. The library should also 
have appropriate assistive devices, audiobooks, books in braille, and other such resources for 
people with disabilities.  
565
Part D
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Teachers have an important role to play in identifying what books need to be purchased and how 
to make use of them for enhancing student learning.  They need to provide students ideas about 
what else they should study and research beyond what is given in the textbooks and should in 
general talk about books keeping in mind interest areas of students. They must come up with 
small assignments which require students to read and write about people, issues and general life 
matters from the library. 
A vibrant library requires a variety of activities in order to develop a culture around reading and 
sharing. Simplest are the read-aloud sessions, oral storytelling, and book reviews. Making a pop-
up or big book, ‘meet the author’ events can be thought of along with creative and restoration 
activities like writing workshop, making bookmarks, book repairs and restoration, designing il-
lustrations, posters, book covers, bookbinding etc. Book donation drives can also be planned. A 
library committee that constitutes teachers, students, and community members could manage 
the various activities and arrangements of the library.
The purchase of new books and other resources can be decided by a library committee in consul-
tation with the School Principal and could include a process of reading book reviews, visiting 
book fairs, and bookstores, and can also take suggestions from students, teachers, community 
etc. 
In most schools, library responsibility is shared by a Teacher and possibly some students. Pro-
cesses of cataloguing, organising, keeping a record of borrowed and returned books, promoting 
careful and gentle handling of books, monitoring damage, wear and tear, and restoring books, all 
these need to be a collective endeavour. When libraries have very strict rules or keep their books 
under lock and key, it defeats the whole purpose of having a library.
2.1.4 Student Committees and Forums
Every school must encourage the formation of students’ committees and forums (Baal Sabha, 
Baal Panchayat, and other Student forums) to involve students in school activities and create a 
sense of ownership and responsibility among them. By participating in activities of different 
committees, students develop responsibility, cooperation, teamwork, pro-activeness, taking ini-
tiative, leadership, and conflict resolution. There can be multiple committees in which students 
can participate for short periods of time and then change over to another committee. This would 
ensure that all students get familiar with the management and functioning of various school 
processes. 
Some of these committees take care of school related tasks such as ensuring cleanliness or man-
aging mid-day-meal or organizing cultural events while some schools also have committees 
which work at community level. Health committee, Sports committee, Eco Club, Music Club, Her-
itage Club etc. take up engagement at community level under Teacher guidance. Through these 
forums, students get to participate in various tasks and develop expertise as well as respect for 
different fields of meaningful work. 
566
Part D
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
2.1.5 Events and Celebrations  
All school celebrations and events must be both enjoyable and meaningful exercises integral to 
the learning processes. Through a well-planned annual calendar, the events and celebrations can 
be integrated with various aspects of the academic plan. 
Schools can conceptualize small and large celebrations imaginatively. Apart from the usual annu-
al day and national festivals, there could be periodic celebrations of student learning and achieve-
ments, welcoming a new teacher or a new group of students, farewell for outgoing students, 
achievements of school alumni and school’s contribution to the community welfare, activity/
games and interaction with parents and community members, local food festivals and so on. The 
school team may decide to cook and eat together, play together, or take up some school-level or 
community-level work collectively at least once a month and this event itself could be a celebra-
tion of unity and collective enjoyment. For Annual Day, national festivals, and Sports Day, the 
school would need more elaborate planning and preparation as this is the time when larger 
community is also involved. 
Preparation: All events require adequate preparation and arrangements. The process of plan-
ning, selection of programmes, preparation of invitation material, posters, decorations, rehears-
al, anchoring and interaction with guests, all of these should involve students’ participation. Re-
hearsals and preparation for events should be a part of the overall teaching-learning process 
where students get opportunities to present as an extension of their classroom activities and 
learning. This implies that classroom activities include arts integration and are multi-disci-
plinary.
Presentations: The presentation of programmes do not require the pomp and show with elab-
orate costumes, stage props, and makeup in the younger age groups. Students need to wear com-
fortable clothes for activities that involve physical movement and dance. They could adopt other 
strategies like masks, headgear, and symbolic paper costumes. Students, teachers, and the local 
community could be encouraged to provide live acoustic music support, rather than using re-
corded music. 
Judicious use of resources: Schools should be conscious of the use of resources and time and 
plan the events with sensitivity and careful thought. Schools should consciously use eco-friendly 
materials, and ensure cleanliness and order throughout the event, and avoid generating noise 
pollution caused by powerful sound systems and amplifiers. Participation of all can be ensured 
by organising more frequent small-scale events where different groups of students get a chance 
to present and participate. Those who have presented in one event can participate as the audi-
ence in the others.
567
Part D
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Section 2.2 
Curricular Associate Processes
For effective teaching-learning to happen, some processes are required for Teachers to collec-
tively reflect on and improve the quality of teaching. Similarly engaging parents so they also 
provide requisite support, and maintaining good health of students have significant mediating 
effect on learning. 
2.2.1 Teacher collaboration and Professional Development
Teachers’ professional competence and collaborative efforts is the most critical factor affecting 
student learning. Every school needs effective processes that enable this. It is the main responsi-
bility of the School Principal. Trusting and respecting them is the foundation and Principals can 
do it in multiple ways – by listening to them, by providing them the facilities and resources to 
work, by arranging academic and other support, and by involving them as equal partners in 
school related decision making. Basic bonding among teachers and School Principal is necessary 
for the success of initiatives towards school improvement.
Schools requires mechanisms that facilitate sharing, reflection and working together among 
teachers. Teachers need to realize that teaching in a school context is a collective responsibility, 
so they need to rise above the notion of teaching as an individual act limited to a subject domain 
centred around prescribed syllabus and textbook. Having subject-based groups at school or 
school cluster/complex level will help teachers to get a sharing and learning platform, new ideas 
and resources as well as appreciation and critical feedback. Wherever possible, teachers of dif-
ferent curricular areas could collaborate to create integrated plans that are implemented togeth-
er. Monthly forums of mixed group teachers can take up generic issues – like how to address 
adolescence related issues – for which teachers are not adequately prepared. A culture of peer 
reviewing of each other’s work, observing classes of other Teachers, and documenting one’s ex-
periences will go a long way in teacher learning. Without teacher collaboration for learning, it is 
difficult to imagine a vibrant school culture and effective school processes.
Senior teachers can be identified and groomed to become mentor teachers for the new teachers. 
There could be a well thought out school-based induction for the new teachers in which they get 
to learn about the vision and practices of the school and the expectations from them as well as 
the nature of support available. Journal writing, documenting one’s teaching experiences and 
writing articles for various education periodicals is yet another way for teacher development as 
writing helps one systematize one’s thoughts and experiences. This also enables teachers to 
reach beyond school audience and connect to the wider community of education professionals.
Teachers also need time to breathe, relax and engage in recreational activities. As students are 
taken to excursion tours and film screening, sports day or club activities are organized for stu-
dents, similar efforts are needed for the group of teachers.   
568
Part D
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
2.2.2 Engaging with Parents and Communities
Schools need to build quality relationships with parents and community to not only assist stu-
dent learning but also fulfil the larger role a school is expected to play in the life of the communi-
ty it serves.  Here are some possible ways schools can make parents and community members 
real partners: 
At the very beginning, when parents come for admission for their children, an orientation on 
what the school stands for, its teaching-learning processes and expectations from parents must 
happen. This could be done in several forms – one to one meeting where individual queries can 
be responded to; meeting with a group of parents where a presentation on the school can be 
given and sharing a written document about what parents should know. A tour of the school 
premises led by students would be a more creative and effective way of doing this. By interacting 
with students, parents would get a good feel of what teachers would be sharing.  
Parents should get regular updates on student progress. Parents Teacher Meeting (PTM) should 
not be primarily about telling parents what issues and challenges being faced with their children 
but what all their children are learning, and the efforts being made by the school. Maintaining an 
updated student progress portfolio will be a huge help in doing this sharing and parents will be 
happy to see how the school is keeping a proper record of student progress. On PTM days, schools 
could organize activities for them that they would love to participate in and enjoy. This will help 
build camaraderie among the parent body. Students can give some live performances of what 
they have learnt. Different students should get a chance for sharing if a school organizes such 
events.
Parents must be invited to school functions and celebrations. Schools must find ways to engage 
them actively in such events rather than keeping them as mere audiences/spectators. So, design 
of such functions and celebrations should aim for active engagement of parents. They could also 
be asked to visit the school on any working day according to their convenience to observe regu-
lar school functioning. They can sit in the morning assembly and later spend some time in the 
classes. During intervals, they can interact with students and teachers. This will give them a first-
hand experience of what goes on in a school on a normal day. Some parents could also be seen as 
important resource persons who can, under a well-thought-out plan, can contribute academical-
ly too. Bagless day is one such window where parental engagement can be planned.  
Teachers should also visit parents periodically as knowing the home environment and the larger 
socio-cultural context of children is a pre-requisite for providing more customized support to 
students.   
The school’s relationship should not be limited to the current group of parents. The larger com-
munity from where students come to school should also be involved systematically in school 
processes. One simple way to reach out to them is to invite them to events, functions, and cele-
brations where it is easier to accommodate larger groups. Exhibitions of work by students, Baal 
Mela, book fairs, film festivals, health camps, cleanliness drives, and campaigning for other social 
awareness causes are opportunities to engage with the larger community. If the school publishes 
any newsletter or magazine, it can also be distributed to a larger audience. Community based 
events and service by student clubs (for example, sports clubs, art and culture clubs, health and 
wellness clubs etc.) can be organized. Schools should have an active alumni group and with their 
help, it would be a lot easier to build and sustain this connection.   
569

National Curriculum Framework for School Education
2.2.3 Mealtime, Health, and Hygiene
NEP 2020 clearly points out that nutrition plays a very significant role in learning, particularly in 
the early years; however, too many of our students are malnourished as they simply do not re-
ceive balanced diet for proper physical growth. Hunger and malnutrition indeed prevent too 
many students from actively participating in school processes. For such students, the mid-day-
meal provided in school is the only proper meal that they eat. 
So, paying attention to mid-day-meal goes a long way in ensuring good health of students and 
thereby improving their participation in school and finally learning. Where food is cooked in 
school, there is greater opportunity to ensure quality and variety of food. Good hygienic practic-
es are required for cooking and serving. Groups of Teachers and students can take serving re-
sponsibility in rotation basis. Efforts are needed to avoid wastage of food or proper use of the 
leftovers. It could also be used for compost generation.
Mealtime is also about observing food habits of students. Some students don’t like to eat some 
dishes and if they bring eatables from home, it could be processed food directly bought from 
shops. So, school needs to consciously create opportunities for dialogue around food, food habits 
and our health, culture, and traditions. Another possibility is to discuss food choices and what 
influences them. How does discrimination occur based on food and eating habits? Dialogue 
around such questions helps students understand the social-cultural aspect of food. 
Schools need to organize regular medical camps at the school and cluster level. This could be 
done with support from government health department. The height and weight of all students in 
the school could also be monitored on a regular basis and recorded systematically. In the case of 
students who are found to have any specific medical conditions that could range from poor eye-
sight, skin allergies, or any symptoms of vitamin deficiencies, dialogue with their parents/fami-
lies could be initiated and necessary care and treatment followed up on a regular basis. For any 
serious health conditions, the schools could ask the parents/families to seek proper medical at-
tention.
Due to various circumstances, many students struggle with hygiene issues. As a Teacher, it is 
important to ensure that hygiene issues among students are handled with sensitivity. Here are 
some pointers to keep in mind when such issues arise in school. 
a. Empathize with the student’s situation, find out the reasons behind the issues and help the  
 
students address their hygiene difficulties.
b. Where students lack resources at home to ensure basic hygiene, the school could provide  
 
them e.g., soaps, nail clippers, sanitary pads for girls.
c. Make hygiene a class practice routine for everyone. 
d. Opportunities could be found in subject teaching, in assembly and by involving local  
 
community members/NGOs to educate the students in the classroom on good health and  
 
hygiene practices.
e. Proper hygiene practices must be followed in residential schools and schools with kitchen  
 
facilities. Food and other edible items must be stored carefully and hygienically.  Dining  
 
areas and other spaces where children eat their meals must also be clean and hygienic.

Section 2.3 
Organisational Processes 
These are processes that enable the visualization and smooth functioning of the above two cate-
gories of school processes. 
2.3.1 School Development Plan 
Most important among these is to prepare a school development plan that covers all aspects of 
school functioning. It sets yearly priorities and decisions are made for addressing challenges and 
taking initiatives to achieve goals in a timeframe.
As the saying goes, when we fail to plan, we basically plan to fail. School improvement is at the 
core of all planning and review exercises, and it requires the whole school team to have the vision 
about where they want to reach ultimately and in shorter durations with a clear understanding 
about where the school stands today.
It is the responsibility of School Principals to constantly work towards aligning the entire team’s 
vision for the school in every aspect with the vision of the national education policy. Simultane-
ously they also need to regularly build consensus over how to respond to local and contextual 
issues that may arise in the life of a school. Here under, some major dimensions of school plan-
ning are briefly described: 
Each school needs to do an institution level planning covering all aspects of its functioning with 
clear goals to be achieved during a set timeframe. There may be given formats and processes to 
be followed as prescribed by the education department. For example, which stakeholders need 
to participate in this exercise. The participation of the community and school management com-
mittee is also crucial in this endeavour. Senior students can also be involved along with identified 
local people who could bring in both ideas and support in some form. 
A good school development plan should set clear academic and administrative goals along with 
implementation level clarity regarding who will do what and if resources are required than how 
and where to mobilise those resources. One major part of it will be curricular planning for the 
year, broken down into quarterly and monthly timeframe. One needs a good understanding of 
last year’s progress and current challenges at subject and student level to do both strategic and 
detailed planning. Both stage level and subject level planning would be needed so teachers need 
to collaborate to develop these plans.
Other aspects to be covered in this plan are of the enabling nature. What to do for teacher sup-
port and development; what resources need to be procured or created; if any major repair and 
maintenance tasks are there; and what more could be done to engage parents and community.
Processes for communicating decisions, expectations, and feedback must be planned well. Most 
of the communication should be through formal meetings and properly documented. Deciding 
modes of communication is equally important. 
School Principals need to closely monitor and provide hand-holding support to teachers and 
support staff without which they may struggle. Implementation and review related planning are 
equally important. Thinking through steps towards achieving the set goals help a school prog-
ress and monthly, quarterly review helps in making mid-course corrections.  
571

2.3.2 Time and Resource Allocation
A critical part of planning is to make best use of available time and other resources as well as 
generating the required resources. 
2.3.2.1 
Annual Calendar
Schools need to plan their whole academic year at the beginning through an annual school calen-
dar. This should include - session start and end dates, admission related schedule, examinations, 
national festivals (Republic Day, holidays, Independence Day), dates of different functions and 
day celebrations like sports day, science day, children’s day, field trips, PTMs, holidays for student 
and teachers, alumni meetings, summer camps etc. Alignment with important dates as shared by 
the education department and local community level engagements is also necessary. This list 
should be made through a collective exercise with Teachers and parents and should be shared 
with all stakeholders including students. Any strategic decision regarding daily timetable is also 
done at the time of preparing the school development plan.
2.3.2.2 
Mobilizing and Allocating Resources
Schools have some fixed resources and some that get consumed in the teaching-learning process. 
At the start of the year, proper planning needs to be done around what resources will be needed, 
how to procure and/or mobilize them and who all will be making use of them. Certain resources 
like computer, printer could be there in the staff room and a register could be maintained for 
keeping track of prints. Similarly, stationery for Teachers’ use could be placed in a common al-
mirah in the staff room. If a computer lab for students is available, then one teacher should over-
see its use and upkeep. For mobilising resources from community and from public, systematic 
efforts would be needed in the leadership of School Principal or a committee in which selected 
parents and students can also be members.
2.3.3 Ensuring Student Safety
Schools need to ensure that all students are protected from any kind of injury or harm. Students 
are not only vulnerable to physical injury but are also exposed to various forms of discrimina-
tion, harassment and abuse that cause emotional harm and can even scar them for a long time. 
The safety and well-being of every life on the school campus must always be given the utmost 
priority. This can be achieved by promoting and practising safety in all school processes on a 
regular basis. Safety within the school premises is the collective responsibility of the whole 
school community.

2.3.3.1 
Physical Safety
i. Road safety around the schools is an important aspect that needs to be given due attention.  
 
School authorities and School Management Committees could work with local 
 
administrators to ensure that appropriate road signage that marks school zones, are 
 
installed. 
ii. Periodic inspections of buildings and equipment including play equipment, laboratory  
 
equipment and furniture could be conducted. All indoor infrastructure must be free of sharp  
 
edges, splinters, and objects that could potentially cause physical injury to anyone. 
 
Potentially hazardous equipment, laboratory chemicals and sharp tools must be stored  
 
carefully and accessible only to responsible adults. The age of students should be considered  
 
if they are to use these objects and must always be done under the supervision of Teachers/ 
 
adults. Clear communication procedures could be followed to instruct students on how to  
 
use laboratory equipment, as well as other guidelines for using play equipment, rules for  
 
field trips or excursions, etc.
iii. Safety and first-aid kits must be easily accessible and available for use.
iv. It is suggested that a responsible adult supervises students during breaks and play time on  
 
the playground and corridor, staircase, and any other open areas. 
v. Teachers and adults in the school must ensure that students of all ages and genders are  
 
protected from physical offences, violence, and sexual offences. School administrations  
 
should have stringent measures to check and stop all forms of corporal punishment meted  
 
out towards students.
vi. Schools could conduct regular fire drills involving all members of the school to orient  
 
students, Teachers, and other staff on how to evacuate the building safely and help those in  
 
need.  Open spaces that could serve as safe assembly areas during natural disasters also  
 
need to be demarcated and clearly communicated. 
vii. In case of an accident or a medical emergency, a supervising adult to take a decision and  
 
inform parents immediately. If a child feels unwell in school but it is not a medical 
 
emergency the Teacher may contact the parents and ask them to pick up the child or if  
 
possible, some responsible person from school may take the child home after ascertaining  
 
that there will be somebody responsible at home. Alternatively, if there is a place to rest, the  
 
child may rest and return home at the normal time.   
2.3.3.2 
Emotional Safety
The school is intended to be a place where all children are treated equally, and they feel safe and 
completely free of the fear of adults or peers. All schools could orient their staff and teachers on 
the harm caused by emotional trauma caused by verbal abuse, threats, and ill-treatment, partic-
ularly on young minds. It is also important for schools to be aware of the home environment of 
students, and whether they may be facing or witnessing any form of physical or emotional abuse, 
and discrimination. Initiating dialogue and showing concern for the well-being of all children 
develop mutual trust between students and teachers and create a space for authentic sharing.  
Students could use such opportunities to openly express their discomfort, fears, and anxieties 
about any spaces, objects, people, animals, and other beings that could be the cause, and resolve 
these issues without delay. The school environment and culture must always strive to practice 
573
Part D
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
values of love, kindness, compassion, empathy, ahimsa and seva as mentioned in NEP 2020. 
Teachers should be encouraged to always use positive language with students and provide en-
couragement that reinforces affirmative behaviour and actions in the classroom and otherwise. 
It is equally important to pay attention to the emotional safety of Teachers and other adults on 
the school premise. Feeling emotionally secure plays a critical role in all adults’ lives, and posi-
tively impacts their ability to take responsible decisions in all tasks. Students constantly observe 
the behaviour and actions of adults and often mimic what they see. It is therefore important for 
all Teachers and adults to model emotional regulation, compassion, and affirmative speech in 
their daily routines.
2.3.3.3 
Intellectual Safety
Learning requires sustained intellectual engagement, so students need to feel safe to take risks 
while expanding their thinking capacities. This implies that mistakes will occur and committing 
errors is accepted as a part of a healthy learning process.  It is important that all students freely 
express their opinions without the anxiety of being ridiculed, reprimanded, or punished. 
The classroom environment should encourage the participation of all children to respond to 
questions and contribute to discussions with the confidence that what they say has value, even if 
it may be incorrect; because it provides insights into how every individual student perceives the 
world and how each may have a unique way of learning and understanding. Using demeaning 
language, labelling, or personally criticising students could hurt their self-esteem and result in 
poor participation in learning activities. Teachers often assign specific responsibilities to certain 
students with the assumption (spoken or unspoken) that others are not capable of carrying out 
the same task. This immediately sends a message to the other students that they might not be 
“good enough” and lowers their confidence. Care must be taken to rotate all responsibilities 
among all students and include Teachers and adult staff in working along with students to pro-
vide timely encouragement and support to those who may face difficulties.  
2.3.3.4 
Preventing Sexual Harassment   
All schools must be aware of and stringently adhere to the laws pertaining to POSH (Prevention 
of Sexual Harassment) for adults and POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses). All 
adults at the school must behave in a manner that reflects the values of being an educator and 
responsible adult and protect their colleagues and students from sexual transgressions and vio-
lations. This is an area of safety that schools must show zero tolerance for.   
Some examples of sexual harassment include passing unsavoury remarks, gender-based insults 
or sexist remarks, making obscene jokes, innuendoes and taunts, displaying pornographic or 
other offensive or derogatory pictures, cartoons, pamphlets or sayings, making unwelcome sex-
ual overtures in any manner over any medium or in person, touching or brushing against the 
body of others, body gestures and manners that could be offensive or frightening to the other 
gender, forcible physical touch or molestation, physical confinement against one’s will and any 
other act likely to violate one’s privacy.  
574
Part D
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
2.3.3.5 
Cyber Safety
It is important to establish clear norms for the use of computers and the internet. Students must 
be taught cyber safety, the appropriate use of technology and the internet, and be educated about 
the function of, and disruption caused, by screens and handheld gadgets. Students using comput-
ers as part of their school curriculum must always access the internet under Teacher supervi-
sion. This will enable the appropriate learning of the medium and help with monitoring student 
activity, safeguarding them from potential cyber risks like online impersonation, bullying, unreg-
ulated and inappropriate adult content, and so on. Another crucial step in protecting students is 
to prepare the computers for students’ use by blocking noneducational and inappropriate sites 
so that they become inaccessible. Web cameras may be used for school projects and other organ-
ised class activities only under Teacher supervision and in no other circumstances. 
It will be educationally valuable and relevant for students to be taught both, the usefulness as 
well as the problems of social media platforms. The pandemic enforced the widespread use of 
smartphones and tablets for participating in online classes. However, this seems to have brought 
along with it a screen dependence in students across the age groups, affecting their capacity for 
focused attention and ‘deep reading’. 
2.3.3.6 
General Safety Measures    
a. Addresses and phone numbers of parents to be regularly updated and kept accessible –  
 
emergency contact numbers must be available for all students/adults.  
b. Information about any medical condition and the associated medication or preventive  
 
measures to be obtained at the time of recruitment/admission, updated regularly, and made  
 
available to all concerned.   
c. Information about any emotional upheaval or trauma that the child may be going through  
 
temporarily to be made available to all concerned teachers.   
d. Telephone numbers of the closest medical centre/hospital/doctor, ambulance, fire station  
 
and police station to be easily accessible - put up in a central place for all to see. 
e. Private transportation facilities that are being used by students need to be checked regularly  
 
for safety standards e.g., in the case of using private transport, the vehicle condition must be  
 
verified and in proper order, a background check of the drivers must be carried out to  
 
ensure that they have a valid driver’s license and are of sound health.
f. Digital devices should have child-protection features to ensure online safety of all children.
2.3.4 Resolving Differences, Conflicts, and Disciplinary  
  
Issues
This section talks about the mechanisms to deal with matters of indiscipline and conflicts en-
countered in the school life. This could be in the form of irregularity, lack of seriousness towards 
classwork, homework, teasing, passing comments, rivalry, bullying, damage to school property, 
sexual harassment, substance abuse etc. Here are some suggested steps:
575
Part D
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
a. Clear communication on expected behavioural norms and consequences.
 
There should be written behavioural expectations which must be communicated to students  
 
and parents at the time of admission. These should largely be defined in positive terms and  
 
if there is a student diary then school rules should also find space there. Staff room,  
 
classroom and general notice board of the school can also have this for ready reference.  
 
From time to time, in school assembly or in classroom situation, these could be discussed so  
 
that the rationale behind school rules could be communicated and understood properly.  
 
Consequences or not abiding by the rules should also be clear, communicated and followed.
b. Polite reminders and encouragement for self and peer led correction.
 
There should be ways of drawing attention to any lapse of expected behaviour. This should  
 
be done politely with an expectation that the person involved will avoid repeating it. For  
 
example, there could be a chart on the classroom wall for students in the Preparatory Stage  
 
where they self-rate their participation in classroom and school activities. In higher Grades,  
 
students themselves can speak to the erring students.  When majority follow the rules then  
 
those who are not following get easily identified and one can be expected to take corrective  
 
measures. 
c. Dialogue and counselling
 
Next step is to have dialogue with those who have difficulty following the rules, and in some  
 
cases with the whole class or school as collective efforts may be needed. Class Teachers or in  
 
extreme cases, the School Principal, could hold this dialogue as this would demand a certain  
 
level of maturity and expertise. These dialogues need to be carried out with empathy as well  
 
as firmness. One will have to do it separately rather than in front of others. The intent should  
 
be to understand why a student is behaving in ways which is detrimental to one’s own  
 
learning and that of others. Few Teachers could be identified and be trained to counsel  
 
students. At the school complex level, a counsellor can be appointed to assist teachers in  
 
dealing with special cases. 
d. Withdrawal from activity/classes, temporary isolation, warning, fine, consultation  
 
with parents 
 
When the earlier steps don’t work; there is repeated instances of rule breaking; violence,  
 
intentional damage to school property, then these measures would be required. 
e. Expulsion from school
 
This is the last resort. If nothing works then, in the interest of others safety and for smooth  
 
functioning of school, this step may be required.
If schools make their best efforts in building nurturing culture and by keeping students meaning-
fully engaged, the instances of indiscipline will anyway get minimized. Classroom processes 
should not allow small incidents to hijack the learning objectives for the day. As classroom man-
agement skill, one must learn what to pay attention to and address immediately, what to ignore 
and what to attend afterward. It has been observed that frequent disruptions and lack of consis-
tency in the teaching-learning process is an important factor leading to low levels of learning. 
Incidents of undesirable behaviour should be forgotten once the erring students make amends 
and should not be used for showing any inappropriate behaviour on the part of the others. 
576
Part D
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
2.3.5 Data Management and Reporting
All schools must develop efficient systems for recording, storing, and utilizing various kinds of 
data. Progress review, planning and reporting - all depend on authentic data and its interpreta-
tion so a proper sourcing, upkeep of data (if possible, in computerized form) will be of great help. 
The most critical set of data for schools is regarding student learning. Keeping track of student 
progress in both qualitative and quantitative ways is needed at the level of teachers and the 
School Principals. Simple things like how students’ reading and writing skills are improving over 
months or grades informs teachers about the impact of their teaching. Similarly, tracking student 
attendance helps us see how it impacts student learning. School Principal and teachers need to 
regularly study student learning data to understand the status and to take requisite steps timely.
Though proper data management is a must for each school, it should aid student learning efforts 
rather than becoming a burden for teachers. Intelligent use of technology has a lot of potential to 
ease things on this front. The responsibility of recording and managing data will be distributed 
for class level but it should also be collated by one person (school admin, Principal, or a Teacher) 
to see the overall picture.

Chapter 1 
Ensuring an appropriate 
Environment for Learning
We would like all students to look forward to coming to school every day. A safe and stimulating 
physical environment can help to make school a positive experience for all. Studies have also 
shown that when physical spaces are carefully designed to cater to the needs of students, they 
can have a positive impact on their overall well-being and learning. 
Since most students spend close to six hours a day in school where they are engaged in a variety 
of activities, it is important to design school infrastructure in a way that addresses learning re-
quirements and allows for play, gatherings, interaction with others and interaction with nature. 
All these aspects contribute to learning and support the smooth functioning of school processes.
Quality, completeness, and maintenance of infrastructure is a key differentiator between a good 
school and a not-so-good one, especially in the eyes of parents and community.
Safe, barrier-free, and adequate physical infrastructure must be available as per prescribed 
norms. Buildings and equipment must meet safety standards as per the law. Adequate budgets 
and utilization for infrastructure development, infrastructure maintenance and teaching-learn-
ing material must be available.
While the importance of safe and adequate infrastructure is well-recognised, many schools still 
struggle to meet the basic requirements for a conducive learning  environment. On the other 
hand, there are many schools that have taken several initiatives to improve their infrastructure 
and ensure a better learning environment for their students through strong School Management 
Committees and with the help of local communities. These schools have applied many creative 
ideas to overcome space and resource limitations to achieve learning goals. Collaboration among 
school administrations, local authorities, and the local community can play a critical role in find-
ing solutions to infrastructural challenges that many schools face. Some basic requirements that 
all schools should aim to address are detailed out in the following sub-sections.
580

National Curriculum Framework for School Education
581
Part E
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Section 1.1 
Outdoor Infrastructure
Schools exist in varied environments across the country - from the midst of a busy main street 
with heavy traffic to the midst of an idyllic landscape, bordering a forest. Setting up a school with 
the right infrastructure and safety measures can be a challenge in many locations across the 
country.
All schools must ensure that basic standards for infrastructure and safety are met to help ensure 
learning for all students. 
1.1.1 Basic Structure and Compound Wall
School buildings should be permanent structures constructed with appropriate materials that 
ensure structural stability and long-term safety of all individuals who use the space. The school 
boundaries and grounds need to be protected from various external elements that could threat-
en the safe movement of students and so, a compound wall and a secure gate can ensure that 
entry and exit of visitors to the school are properly organised and monitored. 
1.1.2 Open Space for Play and Safe Assembly 
An outdoor open space in schools can double up as a space for students to play, as well as a place 
for large gatherings or a dedicated assembly point in the case of any emergency (e.g., fire, natural 
disaster). Schools could opt to install play equipment like swings, climbing frames, slides, jungle 
gyms and so on for young students. 
1.1.3 Trees, Plants and Nature  
Nature is a great Teacher.  The presence of trees (including local fruit trees) and plants where 
students can find shade, explore and invent their own games, and observe birds, insects and but-
terflies has a positive impact on learning. In addition to local flora and fauna, schools could have 
a dedicated kitchen garden where students participate in growing and nurturing plants, and a 
composting pit to process organic waste from the kitchen. 
1.1.4 Ramps and Lifts 
Schools must take measures to make the physical environment accessible for people and stu-
dents with disability. Ramps must be provided for wheelchair access, and lifts can be provided in 
schools that need them. 
582
Part E
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Section 1.2   
Indoor Infrastructure 
1.2.1 Classrooms
Classrooms are where Teachers and students spend a majority of their time in schools. Schools 
must have sufficient classrooms to accommodate all students comfortably and ensure that the 
dignity of every student is respected. 
Classrooms must be well-ventilated and well-lit spaces. Depending on the climatic conditions 
and school requirements, basic lights, fans, and electric power outlets with safe electrification 
would also need to be provided in classrooms. 
The design of classrooms must take into consideration accessibility for all students and people 
with disability, the nature of different subjects and the recommended pedagogy, movement for a 
variety of learning activities, furniture for flexible seating arrangements, blackboards for Teach-
ers and students, and facilities for storage and display.  
Classroom organisation could be flexible in some cases, giving students the opportunity to move 
to other rooms. For example, a room dedicated for language learning could be designed to offer 
an immersive print-rich environment with easily accessible resources for different learning lev-
els across Grades. Similarly, dedicated rooms for the arts could be planned for conducting arts 
activities, with the provision of sufficient space for movement and storage of materials, props, 
stationery, and instruments.  Wherever possible, schools could consider making provisions for 
using digital technologies and equipment to support learning practices (TV/projector/ interac-
tive board either in the classrooms or as a commonly shared multipurpose media room).
1.2.2 Libraries 
Depending on the space available in the school, there can be three types of libraries set up. 
a. School library
This is a separate room dedicated for use as a library with adequate furniture to store a 
wide range of books arranged and catalogued systematically, for students and Teachers.  
Books could be categorized according to reading level, language, subject, and so on. System-
atic labelling could help students navigate through the collection and also maintain entries 
in a library record book.  
Story books for early readers are usually light and full of colourful pictures. These can be 
hung on the wall at a lower level using a string to draw the attention of younger readers, 
provide easy access for them to choose different books to browse through or spend time 
reading or to help them decide which books they want to read.   
Such a library could also include multimedia and audio-visual learning resources with 
computers, projectors and other relevant devices available.  
There should be sufficient space and appropriate furniture for students to sit comfortably 
583
Part E
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
and spend time reading, researching, and accessing resources in the library. 
b. Classroom library, Corner library 
If a school has limited space, libraries can be set up in classrooms with appropriate material 
available for that particular Grade.  
A corner library could also be set up in one part of a particular classroom. Here too, book-
shelves, tables or cupboards can be used to place the books. 
c. Community library
A school could also choose to make its library more open by extending it for the use of the 
local community after school hours. A school could also set up a part of the library outside 
the school premises, in a place that gives access not only to its students but to students of 
other schools, or other children and adults in the community. Such initiatives can become 
lively and enriching centres especially when different people contribute books, periodicals, 
magazines towards the library collection.   
School alumni, youth, and adults could volunteer to help early readers by reading to them, 
organising story-telling activities, or by managing the library resources. A community 
library could also serve as a space for students to study after school hours, get together and 
help one another with their homework.
1.2.3 Laboratories
Although laboratories are commonly associated only with science, schools must aim to expand 
the idea of a laboratory to all disciplines. Laboratories must be kept open and accessible to stu-
dents during their learning hours. They must be perceived as spaces for ‘doing’ - extending to a 
variety of learning experiments across discipline, where students explore, discover, and verify 
knowledge. 
For example, students can access instruments required for measurement and geometry along-
side the raw materials like wood to create their own measuring instruments. A lab can also have 
a stock of natural clay that can be used for visualising and creating 3D models, seals, toys, and 
other resources that can aid learning. The concept of a laboratory could be extended to work-
shops for woodwork/carpentry, electronics, mechanics, pottery, textile and sewing in schools for 
Middle and Secondary Stages.
1.2.4 Dining Area and Drinking Water
The area for eating meals must be shaded, clean, spacious, and hygienic. It should be welcoming 
to all people to sit comfortably and eat together. The dining area must also have sufficient space 
and an adequate number of taps for washing dishes and utensils after meals. Easily accessible 
and hygienic drinking water facility should be provided in all schools. Timely maintenance of 
these facilities must be followed.
584
Part E
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
1.2.5 Toilets
Well-lit clean toilets with safe and well-maintained plumbing and uninterrupted supply of water. 
Separate toilets for different genders and people with disability must be provided. Girls’ toilets 
should stock sanitary pads and provide covered dustbins for the safe disposal of used sanitary 
pads.
1.2.6 Semi-open/ Partially Shaded Areas
Schools could also have semi-open areas like partially shaded corridors or verandas where stu-
dents can move safely, sit and play indoor games, or seek shelter from the rain. These areas could 
also accommodate display facilities where charts, poem cards, story cards, students’ art works 
and writings, are presented and changed periodically. Schools could also think of creating inter-
active spaces in these areas, where students find opportunities for sensorial exploration e.g., in-
teractive materials like walls/surfaces with a variety of textures, objects that produce different 
sounds that students can play like musical instruments, wind chimes, can be installed.
1.2.7 Uninterrupted Supply of Water and Electricity
Regular and uninterrupted supply of water and electricity are essential for the smooth function-
ing of any school. Disruption in water supply can impact the hygiene and cleanliness of toilets 
and the kitchen. Electricity is essential to power many devices that are used not only for learning, 
but also to operate computers and other electric and electronic devices that are integrated into 
school routines. 
Schools could work closely with the local administrative authorities to ensure that the supply of 
water and electricity are prioritised for the school. At the same time, steps can be taken to edu-
cate all members of the school staff and students to use water and electricity conscientiously and 
report any misuse.
585
Part E
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Section 1.3 
Infrastructure that Ensures Safety
a. Choice of building material: Physical safety in a school begins with the choice of materials used 
in the construction of the school building. Schools must avoid using easily flammable materials 
like straw and ensure that the construction quality meets all school safety regulation stan-
dards. School building need to be secure permanent structures with long term stability. 
b. Electrification and Plumbing in the building must be standardised and concealed.
c. Doors, Windows, Gates: Toilets for all genders must ensure safety and privacy by installing 
proper doors with latches that can be used by students of all age-groups comfortably.  Win-
dows must be installed in all classrooms to ensure proper ventilation and light. Main entry and 
exit points of the school premises should have gates that can be closed and opened smoothly 
and locked after school hours. 
d. Safety during emergencies: Multiple entry and exit points could be provided to avoid stam-
pedes during emergency evacuations. Schools must have fire safety mechanisms and fire extin-
guishers in proper working condition. They could conduct regular fire drills involving all mem-
bers of the school to orient students, Teachers, and other staff on how to evacuate the building 
safely and help those in need.  Open spaces that could serve as safe assembly areas during 
natural disasters also need to be demarcated and clearly communicated. Helpline and Emer-
gency numbers should be displayed in multiple locations on the school premises. Safety and 
first-aid kits must be easily accessible and available for use.
Other aspects of safety and its operationalisation are provided in the chapter on School Processes.
The Ministry of Education’s Guidelines on School Safety and Security clearly define the measures 
that Schools and other relevant stakeholders must take to create a safe and secure environment for 
all children. They are an excellent resource for all educational institutions and settings.
586
Part E
National Curriculum Framework for School Education
Section 1.4 
Infrastructure that Ensures Inclusion 
All common spaces and common property on the school campus that are meant for students and 
Teachers should be made accessible to all students and Teachers. 
This includes barrier-free access to all parts of the school for people and students with disability 
e.g., entry, exit, corridors, classrooms, library, laboratories, dining areas, play areas, toilets, use of 
furniture, use of learning material.
Particular issues related to inadequate or inadequately-maintained infrastructure can create 
barriers for particular groups of students e.g.., one important reason why many adolescent girls 
have poor school attendance is the lack of proper toilet and sanitation facilities in school. Schools 
must have well-maintained, functional and safe toilets that are suitable for all students.

Chapter 2 
Pupil Teacher Ratio
It is widely understood and accepted that the right Pupil-Teacher Ratio (PTR) enables individual 
attention by Teachers, and therefore can increase student engagement and achievement. 
It is important to look at the PTR as not just a number, but as a measure that would lead to better 
Learning Outcomes. Many crucial classroom processes can be better implemented if the Teacher 
could operate in an environment of favourable PTR.
Pedagogy specialists argue that a lower PTR has a larger impact during the early years of school-
ing. It is found that children who attend schools with lower PTR have a greater likelihood of 
continuing schooling for a greater number of years.
One important caveat is that reducing PTR does not imply filling schools with underqualified and 
contractual Teachers. PTR must be improved through the appointment and professional devel-
opment of qualified Teachers.
Along with improved PTR, issues of infrastructure, and the academic and pedagogic capability of 
Teachers must also be taken care of to take full advantage of lower PTR. There must be a full 
complement of Teachers for all students across all school Stages.

Enabling and Empowering 
Teachers 
The NCF for School Education is one of the core transformational forces of NEP 2020.
As is evident from the previous chapters, the curricular implementation of this NCF requires 
several actions around development of content, pedagogy in the classroom and assessment of 
student learning, all of this within a strong and enabling school culture. 
For all this to happen, a supportive ecosystem is essential. This Section describes the kind of 
ecosystem needed for the implementation of the NCF - availability of adequate infrastructure 
and resources, criticality of Teachers, the role of Academic and Administrative Functionaries, 
Parents and Community in making this happen.
Section 17.1 mentions the infrastructure and learning resources support required to implement 
this NCF. Section 17.2 talks of empowering Teachers in different ways in line with NEP 2020. 
Section 17.3 outlines the role of academic and administrative functionaries. Section 17.4 enu-
merates the importance of parents and community supporting the learning of students.

Ensuring an Enabling Environment 
of Teachers 
A culture that encourages people to learn and work together and is characterised by trust and 
respect for all is critical to a good school - this is possible in an environment that is open and 
caring, and where dialogue, collaboration, enquiry, and reflection are embedded practices.
Teachers need resource-rich, motivating environments and continuous opportunities for profes-
sional learning and interaction. Teachers must feel a sense of pride in belonging to a well-quali-
fied, close-knit, and vibrant professional group.

Pre-Service Teacher Education
The first step is to estimate Teacher demand and supply. This must be undertaken by NCTE on 
priority, building on existing studies related to demand and supply of Teachers for specific Stag-
es.
This will help to ensure that the right number and type of universities offer the four-year Inte-
grated Teacher Education Programme (ITEP) with specializations across School Stages.   
The curriculum for the specializations within the ITEP must be based on the curriculum and 
pedagogy of the NCF. It must also ensure adequate practice opportunities for student Teachers in 
all school environments.
The Teacher Eligibility Test (TET) should also be extended to all teachers of the Foundational 
and Secondary Stages once the re-structuring of school stages is complete. NEP 2020 envisages 
the extension of the TET to cover all stages of education.
This certification of suitability to teach will cover teachers across all kinds of schools. Recruit-
ment of teachers must be through a rigorous process comprising not only a written test but also 
an interview and classroom demonstration, as stated in NEP 2020.

In-Service Teacher Education, Mentoring 
and Support 
Teacher professional development is a journey, and Teachers progress through it at their own 
individual pace.
Teachers will be at different phases of their development journey and will have different devel-
opment needs. Within each phase, the learning experience needs to be holistic and complete to 
a point that it can help Teachers to bring about sustained change in their practice and move to 
the next phase.
Professional development of Teachers must be such that they become competent and reflective 
individuals with the ability to drive educational improvement. Teachers must engage continu-
ously with their professional development through a variety of means. Platforms for peer learn-
ing with mentoring and coaching support must be made available.
The NCERT, SCERTs, DIETs, BITEs, BRCs, CRCs provide academic mentoring and support to 
schools and Teachers through the development of support material, capacity building sessions, 
on-site visits, and quality monitoring and supervision.
These academic resource institutions play a key part in ensuring that teacher professional devel-
opment opportunities are continuously available.

Section 3.5 
Career Ladder and Professional Develop-
ment Opportunities
All Stages of school education are critical and will require Teachers who are competent and com-
mitted.  NEP 2020 speaks of parity in service conditions across all Stages of school education.
This means that, as soon as possible and in the long term, pay and service conditions of Teachers 
have to be commensurate with their social and professional responsibilities, and must be set so 
as to attract and retain talented Teachers in the profession.
All Teachers, from Foundational Stage Teachers to Secondary Stage Teachers, will be recruited 
with standard service conditions as per their work requirements, and the same salary structure.
All Teachers must have the opportunity to progress in their career (in terms of salary, promo-
tions, etc) while remaining as Teachers in the same stage of education (i.e., Foundational, Prepa-
ratory, Middle, or Secondary).
The approach will be to ensure that growth in one’s career (salary and promotion) is available to 
Teachers within a single school stage, and that there is no career progression-related incentive 
to move from being Teachers in early stages to later stages (though such career moves across 
stages will be allowed, provided the Teacher has the desire and qualifications for such a move).

Section 3.6 
Teacher Autonomy and Teacher 
Accountability 
Teachers are responsible for student learning and must be held accountable for it. But Teacher 
empowerment and autonomy are preconditions for accountability. Accountability is critical but 
so is autonomy - an empowering culture based on autonomy is a necessary condition for ac-
countability.
Competent and capable Teachers are critical to improve the quality of learning. Supportive envi-
ronments within schools and the eco-system improve teacher effectiveness. Teachers are unique 
individuals, with their own set of beliefs and personal theories about learners, learning, and ed-
ucation.
To a creative and discerning Teacher, every learning episode presents unanticipated opportuni-
ties to spontaneously and naturally stimulate and support learning of what was not planned, and 
to omit, on that particular occasion, learning of what was originally intended or planned.
Teachers must have the pedagogic autonomy to plan and organize content, decide the sequence, 
and methods of teaching children as the situation demands, along with ways of assessing their 
learning. All this must be based on the prescribed Curricular Goals, Competencies, Learning Out-
comes, and pedagogical approaches and principles.

Section 4.1 
Role of Academic and 
Administrative Functionaries
The Head Teacher or School Principal must create a supportive and empowering culture for 
Teachers so that they teach well – helping them in planning classes, providing access to appro-
priate resources, observing classes, and providing constructive feedback, and creating an ethos 
where conversations centre around children’s learning. Another critical role that Head Teachers 
play is that of building relationships with parents and community. 
Academic Functionaries have important roles to play with respect to school visits and on-site 
support, continuous professional development at the cluster-level meetings, in the development 
of innovative learning materials as well as the development of a pool of academic resource per-
sons to support Teachers. Functionaries at the cluster and block levels need to support teachers 
through classroom observation and demonstration of pedagogy. DIETs must develop extensive 
material for children and Teachers in the local language. In addition, DIETs must also create 
plans to support Teachers in the use of these materials. At the level of SCERT the focus should be 
to develop the State curriculum, syllabus, textbooks, and other material. The SCERT should also 
take responsibility for sourcing, contextualising, and anchoring translation of materials wherev-
er necessary.
Administrative Functionaries have a critical role in ensuring appropriate budgetary allocations 
for all aspects of resourcing, availability of teachers, timely supply of teaching-learning material, 
with regular monitoring and review of progress. Appropriate collection and use of data would be 
necessary to ensure access to Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Groups. The integration 
of technology for this purpose would reduce effort while ensuring that data-based decision mak-
ing becomes possible very quickly.
An indicator of the quality will be the attainment of Competencies and learning outcomes. The 
NAS makes this tracking possible. In addition to NAS, States may plan State Learning Achieve-
ment Surveys (SLAS) with this focus.
Large-scale advocacy through public service messages and media campaigns, direct communica-
tion with parents, and wide-scale dissemination of simple methods and materials needed to en-
able parents to actively support their students’ learning needs could also be designed.

Section 4.2 
Role of Parents and Community
Parents and family are co-partners with the school in their children’s learning and development. 
Communication with parents needs to be frequent and ongoing, with parents being treated as 
equal partners in the process of the child’s education. This could be done by inviting parents to 
school regularly for discussions about their child’s learning, and by the Teacher conducting home 
visits. Parents and families can contribute to the school in several ways – be part of the School 
Management Committee, participate in celebrations, share knowledge and expertise in specific 
topics, support Teachers during field trips, and co-teach or observe classes. Parents can also plan 
and run events in the school like Sports Day or Annual Day.
The local community is defined as parents, family, residents of the neighbourhood, youth groups, 
community leaders, and local governance institutions. The community could be involved in and 
support the school in several ways. For example, ensure enrolment and regular attendance, mo-
bilise funds for infrastructure and learning materials, organise ingredients for more nutritious 
meals locally, and so on.

1.5 Wide and Inclusive Process for 
 
Development of the National Curriculum  
 
Framework
The National Steering Committee (NSC) for the NCF, along with the Ministry of Education, and 
the NCERT, designed a large-scale, inclusive, and iterative process for the development of the 
NCF. This process benefited from the diverse and vibrant educational landscape of our country.
The process started with the States and Union Territories (UTs) setting up State Focus Groups 
which together had over 4000 experts, to write Positions Papers on 25 themes relevant to the 
development of the NCF. More than 500 papers were submitted by 32 States and UTs. 
25 National Focus Groups were also formed to develop Position Papers on these 25 themes with 
an integrated national outlook. 
District Institutes of Education and Training (DIETs) from across the country submitted more 
than 1550 District Consultation Reports (DCR). A mobile survey was launched to get inputs from 
Teachers and Educationists - 1,31,00 participants shared their views. 
Alongside, consultation meetings were organized with various Ministries of Government of India 
to understand their vision and how education is important to realising their vision. NGOs, and 
other institutions working on the ground, shared their experiences and suggestions. Seminars 
were conducted in universities .to get suggestions from scholars on their expectations from 
school education. Open consultations were organized with various groups of teachers, parents, 
and students. The Digital Survey for National Curriculum (DiSaNC) was launched to get inputs 
from citizens of India, through 100 questions in various categories, so far over 10 lakh interested 
citizens, including parents and students have given their inputs.
The NSC designed a well-structured process to analyse and synthesize all the inputs received and 
to arrive at the NCF. 
Thus, this NCF is the output of this deeply inclusive process that involved Teachers, parents, rel-
evant government departments in the states, administrators, schools, NGOs working in educa-
tion and allied areas, educationists and scholars from various fields, and other citizens of India.

In every epoch of humankind, knowledge represents the sum of what is created
by all previous generations, to which the present generation adds its own.
The motif of the Mobius strip symbolizes the perpetual, developing and live
nature of knowledge - that which has no beginning and that which has no end.
This Policy envisages creation, transmission, use and dissemination of
knowledge as a part of this continuum.
